- Retrieve and see all users(currently one user in our DB):
	https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users

- Get specific user:
	https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/{users-email}
	Example: https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/test@gmail.com

	Note: you can use this to check if user is already in our DB and follow the following steps:
		* Authenticate the user using firabase
		* After authentication is success, get the email and make a request to https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/{users-email}
			- you will see the users data with 200 response code if it exist
			- otherwise, you will get a 404 response code with '{"message": "User not found"}' response message
				i.e. https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/randomEmail@gmail.com
		* If users exist, then proceed with successful login, otherwise, have the user go through sign up page


- POST Request after filling out form, probably using ajax request:
	URL: https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users
	Header: Content-Type= application/json
	data: see https://github.com/J-Santos/cmpe295B-project/blob/master/BackendServer/SampleRequests/user1.json for example data

	Note: If the user doesn't exist, it will respond with a 201 response code and '{"message": "User created!"}' response data. Otherwise, you will a 500 respond code with the error message "User already exists."


- Update users info(PUT request)
	URL: https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/{users-email} (i.e. https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/test@gmail.com)
	Header: Content-Type= application/json
	data: whatever fields that need to be updated in json format(_id is primary key and cannot be updated)
		Example data to update street: 	{
											"address": {
												"street": "2544 San Jose Way"
											}
										}

- Delete an user
	URL: https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/{users-email} (i.e. https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/test@gmail.com)

	* You can delete it using Postman, ajax request or through the terminal using curl command
	(curl -XDELETE https://remote-health-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/test@gmail.com)
