      "disease": "testicle lump",
      "description": "A testicularlump is an abnormal mass that can form in your testicles. The testicles, or testes, are egg-shapedmale reproductive organs that hang below the penis in a sac called the scrotum. Their primary function is toproduce sperm and a hormone called testosterone.A testicular mass, or lump, is a fairly common conditionthat can have many different causes. Testicular lumps can occur in men, teenageboys, or younger children. They may be located in one or both of your testicles.Testicular lumps are signs of problems with your testicles. They may be causedby an injury, but they can also indicate a serious underlying medical problem.Not all lumps indicate the presence of testicular cancer. Mostlumps are caused by benign, or noncancerous, conditions. These usually requireno treatment. Still, your doctor should examine any changes in your testicles,especially lumps or swelling. There are no studies that show benefits or harmto clinical or personal testicular exams. Whether or not men should do monthlytesticle self-examinations is a controversial issue. However, if you happen tonotice anything unusual, make an appointment with your doctor for a testicularexam. They can treat you early for potential problems."

Children with RAD have often been neglected physically and  emotionally, orphaned early in life, or abused. RAD develops when a child’s  most basic needs for nurturing, affection, and comfort have not been met. This  stops them from forming healthy relationships with others.   RAD  can take two forms, either causing the child to avoid relationships or to be overly  friendly. This  condition can have negative effects on a child’s development and may stop him  or her from forming future relationships. Although RAD is a lasting condition,  with treatment and support, children are eventually able to develop healthy and  stable relationships with others. "

      "disease": "pulmonary edema",
      "description": "Pulmonary edema is a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid. When this occurs, the body  struggles to get enough oxygen.   The most common cause of pulmonary edema is congestive heart  failure. Heart failure is  characterized by the heart no longer being able to pump blood properly  throughout the body.  In pulmonary edema, the heart works harder to push blood  through the body. This puts added pressure on the small blood vessels of the  lungs. In order to relieve this growing pressure, the vessels release fluid  into the lungs.   Ordinarily, the lungs are responsible for taking oxygen from  the air that you breathe and putting that oxygen into the bloodstream. However,  if the lungs are filled with fluid, they cannot properly perform that task. In  cases of pulmonary edema, the lungs cannot put oxygen into the bloodstream, and  the rest of the body is deprived of oxygen.   When doctors treat pulmonary edema, they work to remove the  fluid from the patient’s lungs. If fluids are not removed and continue to  accumulate, a patient may literally drown. Treating the cause of pulmonary  edema is the best method for a full recovery."

According to the Cleveland Clinic, hemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal bleeding. While these and other causes of rectal bleeding may be minor inconveniences, rectal bleeding can be a real concern if you’re losing a lot of blood. "

All the symptoms involve changes in neurologic functioning, but there are striking differences among patients in the type, severity, and frequency of these symptoms. Different disease patterns such as relapsing-remitting (RR), primary-progressive (PP), secondary-progressive (SP), and progressive-relapsing (PR) classify the condition according to the development and progression of symptoms over time. Relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis is the most common type, in which symptoms (exacerbations of the condition) are followed by periods of time with reduced or no symptoms. These relatively symptom-free periods, known as remissions, can last for days or for many years. "

Your body needs iron to make a protein called hemoglobin.This protein is responsible for carrying oxygen to your body’s tissues, whichis essential for your tissues and muscles to function effectively. When thereisn’t enough iron in your blood stream, the rest of your body can’t get theamount of oxygen it needs. While the condition may be common, a lot of people don’tknow they have iron deficiency anemia. It’s possible to experience the symptomsfor years without ever knowing the cause. In women of childbearing age, the most common cause of irondeficiency anemia is a loss of iron in the blood due to heavy menstruation orpregnancy. A poor diet or certain intestinal diseases that affect how the bodyabsorbs iron can also cause iron deficiency anemia. Doctors normally treat thecondition with iron supplements or changes to diet."

Hair loss can develop gradually overyears or happen abruptly. Hair loss can be permanent or temporary.It’s impossible to countthe amount of hair lost on a given day. You may be losing more hair than isnormal if you notice a large amount of hair in the drain after washing yourhair or clumps of hair in your brush. You might also notice thinning patches ofhair or baldness.If you notice that you’re losing more hair than usual, you shoulddiscuss the problem with your doctor.

There are various kinds of autoimmune  disorders that can affect different systems of the body.SS is characterized by changes in the texture and appearance  of the skin due to an increase production of collagen, a component of  connective tissue. However, the disorder is not confined to skin changes. It  can affect blood vessels, muscles, and a number of vital organs such as the  heart, digestive system, lungs, and kidneys. Features of systemic sclerosis can  be seen in other autoimmune disorders and when this occurs, it is called a mixed  connective disorder. The disease is typically seen in individuals ages 30 to 50  years old, but can be diagnosed at any age. Women are four times more likely  than men to be diagnosed with this condition. The symptoms and severity of the  condition can vary among individuals and are dependent on the systems or organs  involved. Systemic sclerosis is also called scleroderma and  progressive systemic sclerosis, or CREST syndrome. CREST syndrome is actually a  limited form of the disorder."

Sometimes, this red mark may take a slightly different shape. In other cases,  the spider may have red markings on its back too.This type of spider gets its name from its mating behavior.  After mating, the females typically kill and then eat their male partners,  leaving them as “widows.”These spiders are not aggressive and only bite when they feel  threatened. The bites are usually not fatal, but can still cause some serious  and uncomfortable symptoms. If a black widow  spider has bitten you, get medical treatment right away.This spider type is found throughout the world. While they  are found all over the United States, they are most common the southern and  western states. "

It is important to remember that  urge incontinence is not a disease in itself. It is a symptom of lifestyle or  medical issues or physical problems. Urge incontinence is one piece of  the larger framework of urinary incontinence. There are several forms of  urinary incontinence, ranging from leaking small amounts of urine to overactive  bladder. Your doctor can diagnose your specific type of incontinence, its  cause, and provide possible treatment options. "

Your  hormones affect this tissue. Hormonal changes can cause lumps to form and in  some cases, to naturally disappear. You can develop lumps at any age. Some  babies develop breast lumps due to the estrogen they get from their mothers  during birth. These generally clear up as the estrogen leaves their bodies.Pre-pubescent  girls sometimes get lumps that feel tender. These later clear up naturally  during puberty. Adolescent boys can also get breast lumps during puberty. These  are temporary and usually disappear in a few months as well."

Usually, people get the symptoms ofWernicke’s encephalopathy first.Also called Wernicke’s disease, people with Wernicke’sencephalopathy have bleeding in the lower sections of the brain, including thethalamus and hypothalamus. These areas of the brain control the nervous andendocrine systems. The bleeding causes brain damage that presents symptomsinvolving your vision, coordination, and balance.The signs of Korsakoff psychosis tend to follow as the Wernicke’ssymptoms decrease. If Wernicke’s disease is treated quickly and effectively,Korsakoff syndrome may not develop. Korsakoff psychosis is the result ofchronic brain damage. Korsakoff syndrome affects the areas of your brain thatcontrol memory.Alcoholism, or chronic alcohol abuse, is themost common cause of WKS. WKS can also be linked to diet deficiencies orother medical conditions that impair vitamin B-1 absorption. Vitamin B-1 isalso called thiamine.To diagnose WKS, your doctor will look for clinical signs thatpoint to a vitamin B-1 deficiency. This can include blood tests that measurethiamine levels and your general nutritional health, as well as tests to checkyour liver function.Chronic alcoholism can damage your liver, elevating your liverenzymes. Diagnosis includes a physical examination to assess your:heart rateeye movementsreflexesblood pressurebody temperatureAfter diagnosis, your doctor will most likely give you vitamin B-1intravenously, or through your vein. Fast treatment may reverse many of theneurological symptoms of WKS.The key to recovery is maintaining adequate vitamin B-1 levels,which means refraining from alcohol abuse if you have WKS. You should also eata balanced diet."

      "description": "Ischemic  cardiomyopathy (IC) is a condition that occurs when the heart muscle is  weakened. In this condition, the left ventricle, which is the main heart muscle,  is usually enlarged and dilated. This condition can be a result of a heart  attack or coronary artery disease, a narrowing of the arteries. These narrowed  arteries keep blood from reaching portions of your heart. The weakened heart  muscle inhibits your heart’s ability to pump blood and can lead to heart  failure. Symptoms of IC  include shortness of breath, chest pain, and extreme fatigue. If you have IC symptoms,  you should seek medical care immediately. Treatment depends on  how much damage has been done to your heart. Medications and surgery are often  required. You can improve your long-term outlook by making certain lifestyle  changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet and avoiding high-risk behaviors,  including smoking. "

They are not life-threatening, but can cause discomfort  and may be unsightly.  Traditionally, a surgery known as “vein stripping” was  performed to remove the veins. This procedure involves small incisions and physically  pulling the veins out of the body. However, more recent technologies have been  developed to remove varicose veins using non-or-minimally-invasive procedures. The  term noninvasive means that the  procedure is nonsurgical and does not involve tools or equipment that cut the  skin or that physically enter the body. Minimally invasive procedures are  performed through tiny incisions in the skin as opposed to a large opening."

Normally, when you press your skin it becomes pale, andwhen you let go, the redness or color returns. When there is bleeding into theskin, the skin will not become pale when you press down on it. Bleeding beneath the skin often results from a minor occurrence, such asbruising. The bleeding can appear as a small dot the size of a pinprick or as apatch as large as an adult hand.

For adults and healthy children,  RSV causes symptoms similar to those of a cold. In infants, however, RSV can be  more serious. Though most of the time the infection  causes no serious damage, it can lead to other serious lung complications.RSV is the most common virus that causes  infections of the lungs and airways in infants and small children. Data  gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that each year  in the United States, between 75,000 and 125,000 children under the age of one  are hospitalized with RSV. (CDC) According to the March of Dimes, the virus is seasonal, and  is most commonly seen from October to March. (March  of Dimes)"

This stage is most common during the first third of sleep, often between the times of midnight and two a.m. (Kaneshiro, 2011). Night terrors are not nightmares, which are a form of dreaming. Because the person may still be partially asleep during a night terror, they can be inconsolable and unaware of their surroundings. They may have no memory of the episode when they awaken. Night terror episodes typically last 10 to 20 minutes.Night terrors are relatively uncommon and predominantly affect children under the age of 12 (Mayo Clinic, 2011). Children typically grow out of night terrors. Children with night terrors often also sleepwalk."

When thismosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream.Once the parasites are inside your body, they travel to theliver, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter thebloodstream and begin to infect red blood cells. Within 48 to 72 hours, theparasites inside the red blood cells multiply, causing the infected cells toburst open. The parasites continue to infect red blood cells, resultingin symptoms that occur in cycles that last two to three days at a time.Malaria is typically found in tropical and subtropicalclimates where the parasites can live. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimatesthat about 3.2billion people are at risk of malaria. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) report 1,500 cases of malariaannually. Most cases of malaria develop in people who travel to countries wheremalaria is more common."

Bulimia is a serious condition that can be life threatening.Bulimia can be broken into two categories: purging and non-purging. Purging bulimia follows the binge-and-purge cycle. People with non-purging bulimia use other strict methods to maintain weight, such as fasting, exercise, or extreme dieting.People with bulimia often have an unrealistic image of themselves, specifically their body image. They are obsessed with their weight and are intensely self-critical. Many people with bulimia are of normal weight or even overweight. This makes bulimia hard to initially notice and diagnose.Bulimia nervosa is most common in females, especially during the teenage and early adult years. Performers are also at greater risk for eating disorders, as are athletes, whose weight and body are closely monitored. Dancers, models, and actors may also be at a higher risk."

This can quickly cause brain and nervedamage.This is a medical emergency requiringimmediate treatment. ICH is not as common asischemic stroke (when a blood vessel is blocked by a clot), but it’s moreserious.Treatment generally involves surgery to relievethe pressure from the accumulation of blood and to repair damaged bloodvessels.

Soft tissue includes blood vessels, nerves, tendons, muscles,  fat, fibrous tissue, lower layers of the skin (in other words, not the outside  layer), and the lining of joints.   Several types of abnormal growths can occur in soft  tissue, but if a growth is labeled a sarcoma, that means it’s a malignant tumor  or cancer. \"Malignant\" means that parts of the tumor can break off  and spread into surrounding tissues. These escaped cells move throughout the  body, lodging in the liver, lungs, brain, or other important organs.  Sarcomas of soft tissue are relatively uncommon,  especially when compared with carcinomas, another type of malignant tumor.  Sarcomas can be life threatening, especially if they are diagnosed when a tumor  is already large or has spread to other tissues.  There are many kinds of soft tissue sarcomas, categorized  by the tissue in which it has grown:  Malignant tumors in fat are liposarcomas. In smooth muscle (around internal organs), cancerous  sarcomas are called leiomyosarcomas. Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant  tumors in skeletal muscle (in arms, legs, muscle that allows movement).  Although they also occur in adults, rhabdomyosarcomas are the most common soft  tissue sarcomas in children.  Other (very rare) soft tissue sarcomas includeneurofibrosarcomasmalignant schwannomasneurogenic sarcomasgastrointestinal stromal tumorssynovial sarcomasangiosarcomasKaposi’s sarcomasfibrosarcomasmalignant mesenchymomasalveolar soft-part sarcomasepithelioid sarcomasclear cell sarcomaspleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomasspindle cell tumors"

It stores bile made by the liver and sends it to the smallintestine via the common bile duct (CBD) to aid in the digestion of fats. TheCBD connects the liver, the gallbladder, and the pancreas to the smallintestine. Gallstones blocking the CBD are the leading cause of cholecystitis.This blockage causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, and that buildupcauses the gallbladder to become inflamed.This is a serious condition. The gallbladder could rupture ifit’s not treated properly, and this is considered a medical emergency. Treatmentusually involves antibiotics, pain medications, and removal of the gallbladder."

It can be palpated or felt at different  pulse points in the body such as the wrist, the neck, and the groin. When the  pulse is absent, you are unable to feel the pulse from any pulse point on the  body. A weak or absent pulse is considered a medical emergency. This symptom  usually indicates a serious problem from within the body, and it should never  be overlooked. Usually, a person with a weak or absent pulse will have  difficulty moving or speaking. If someone is in this condition, call 911  immediately."

It typically happens right before sexual intercourse.  Some women also have these contractions other times, such as when trying to  insert a tampon or when touched near the vaginal area. This is called vaginismus.  The contractions can prevent sexual intercourse. They can also make intercourse  very painful. Vaginismus does not interfere with sexual arousal, but it  can prevent penetration. A gentle pelvic exam typically shows no reason for the  contractions. No physical abnormalities contribute to the condition.Experts do not know exactly how many women suffer from  vaginismus, but the condition is considered to be uncommon, states the National  Institutes of Health (NIH)."

However, risk of infection is  increasing for residents of Texas that live in areas that share a border with  Mexico. Additionally, cases have been on the rise in the Southern United  States. As recently as 2009, an outbreak of dengue fever was identified in Key  West, Florida.Dengue fever is transmitted via  the bite of a mosquito harboring the dengue virus. Person-to-person  transmission does not occur."

The body’s immunesystem reacts to toxins released during an intestinal bacterial infection. Thiscauses damage and destruction to blood cells as they circulate through theblood vessels. These include red blood cells (RBC) and platelets, causing themto die prematurely. The kidney is affected in two ways.The immune reaction cancause direct damage to kidney cells resulting in kidney injury. Alternatively,a build-up of destroyed RBCs or platelets can clog up the kidney’s filtering systemand cause kidney injury or a build-up of waste products in the body, since thekidney can no longer efficiently eliminate waste from the blood.Kidney injury can be quite serious if left untreated. Kidneyfailure, dangerous elevations in blood pressure, heart problems, and stroke areall concerns if HUS advances without prompt treatment.HUS is the most common cause of acute kidney failure inchildren. It is most common in children under the age of 5, although olderchildren and adults can also suffer from the disorder.Fortunately, most people who receive prompt treatment canmake a full recovery without permanent kidney damage."

Testicular cancer issometimes referred to as a germ cell tumor.The two main types of testicular cancer are seminomas andnonseminomas. Seminomas are testicular cancers that grow slowly. They’reusually confined to the testes, but the lymph nodes may also be involved.Nonseminomas are the more common form of testicular cancer. This type is fastergrowing and may spread to other parts of the body.Testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in menages 15 to 35, but it can occur at any age. It’s also one of the most treatablecancers, even if it has spread to other areas. According to the American CancerSociety, for those with testicular cancer in early stages, the five-yearsurvival rate is greater than 95percent. The survival rate is lower for those with more advanced stages oftesticular cancer."

Most copper builds up in the liver and brain. Copper  accumulation in the brain causes neurological problems. Buildup in the liver  can result in liver failure and kidney dysfunction.

      "description": "An epidural hematoma occurs when blood fills thearea between the skull and the protective covering of the brain. If the brain bounces against the inside of theskull during a collision, it can experience tearing of the internal lining,tissues, and blood vessels. This will result in bleeding. A mass of bloodcalled a hematoma may form between the skull and brain. This epidural hematomacreates pressure on the brain. There is no room in the skull for the brain toexpand, so the brain may shift as it swells. The brain structures push togetherand create pressure, which can affect vision, speech, and consciousness. Thebrain may also lose blood supply and die.If you suspect you have an epidural hematoma,you should get immediate medical care. Left untreated, an epidural hematoma cancause brain damage and eventually death."

However, these tumors can spread to other parts of the body, including the  lungs and bone marrow.  Ewing’s  sarcoma is a rare disease. An estimated 250 cases are diagnosed per year in the  United States, according to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDAnderson).

It’s important todistinguish between these two conditions to properly treat symptoms.Morning sickness typically includes nausea that’s sometimes accompanied byvomiting. These two symptoms typically disappear after 12 to 14 weeks, and thevomiting doesn’t cause severe hydration. HG typically includes nausea that doesn’t go away and severevomiting that causes severe hydration and doesn’t allow you to keep any food orfluids down.Morning sickness typically begins in the first month of pregnancy.It usually goes away by the third or fourth month. Pregnant women with morningsickness can get fatigue and a slight loss of appetite. They may havedifficulty performing daily activitiesThe symptoms of HG begin within the first six weeks of pregnancy,and nausea often doesn’t go away. HG can be extremely debilitating and causefatigue that lasts for weeks or months. According to the HERFoundation, women with HG may experience a complete loss of appetite andmay not be able to work or perform daily activities.HG can lead to dehydration and poor weight gain during pregnancy.There’s no known way to prevent morning sickness or HG, but there are ways tomanage the symptoms."

They fill with blood fromthe atria, or top chambers of the heart, and send it to the rest of the body. Ventriculartachycardia is a pulse of more than 100 beats per minute with at least threeirregular heartbeats in a row. It is caused by a malfunction in the heart’s electricalsystem.Your heart rate is controlledby electricalimpulses that trigger each contraction and determine the rhythm of the heart. When this process is disrupted and the electricalsignals are sent too quickly, ventricular tachycardia can occur. The rapidheartbeat doesn’t give the ventricles enough to time to fill with blood beforethe heart contracts. As a result, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to therest of the body. Ventriculartachycardia may only last for a few seconds or for much longer. It doesn’talways cause symptoms, but when symptoms do occur, they may includelightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting. The condition most commonly affectspeople who have heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy.Ventricular tachycardiamay eventually lead to ventricular fibrillation, which is characterized by arapid, inadequate heart rhythm. In this condition, the heartbeat is so fast andirregular that it causes the heart to stop working. To prevent thiscomplication from occurring, it’s important to get immediate treatment forventricular tachycardia."

Usingthese medications for recreation or in a way not recommended by a doctor can beconsidered abuse.Other opioids,like heroin, are illegal.Opioids are highlyaddictive. Abuse can quickly lead to addiction. Both abuse and addiction cancause serious health problems, including death.Opioids can beused in a variety of ways. They can be taken orally, inhaled through the nose,injected into a vein, or smoked in a cigarette. Prescription forms aresometimes used as suppositories. Effects may depend on the method ofconsumption. The type of opioid also determines its effect.Opioids impactthe brain, leading to temporary feelings of intense pleasure. Addiction to opioidscan develop very quickly, even with minimal use. The addiction can be physical,in that a habitual user’s body craves the drug. It can also be mental, in that auser consciously desires the drug’s effects. A person who is addicted toopioids will do whatever it takes to get more of the drug, regardless of therisks or consequences.Long-term opioiduse has serious health consequences, including brain damage. Opioid abuse can impairthe brain’s production of natural painkillers and dopamine (the brain’s “feel-good”chemical)."

When they are late in achieving these milestones, it may  be due to a developmental problem. Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is  one such condition. DCD is a lack of coordination between your mental intentions and your  ability to get your body to carry out those intentions. For example, you might  think, “I need to tie my shoe.” However, your brain does not properly send the  instructions for shoe tying to your hands and feet. Your brain knows how to tie  shoes, but your hands just can’t follow your brain’s instructions. The same  thing happens when you try to run, jump, write, button a shirt, and many other  tasks that most people take for granted. People with DCD generally have normal intelligence. However, DCD is  sometimes called “clumsy child syndrome,” and it may cause others to think that  sufferers are inept or unintelligent because they cannot perform basic tasks.  The condition can be frustrating and embarrassing, leading to problems with  self-esteem and social isolation. Although considered a childhood disorder, the  effects of DCD continue into adulthood. "

These are typically reddened in appearance with silvery scales that have sometimes been said to resemble ashes.  The elbows, knees, and scalp are common sites of involvement, although other areas of skin can be affected, as well. The condition can start as a few red bumps on the skin, and in mild cases, small areas of dry skin may be the only symptoms. Itching and burning sensations can be associated with the lesions on the skin. The nails may be affected, and psoriasis of the nails causes ridged, thick, or pitted nails and can ultimately lead to separation of the nails from the nail bed. Symptoms of arthritis, including stiffness, pain, and swelling of the joints, occur in some people with psoriasis. There are different forms of psoriasis that can affect different areas and produce different kinds of skin changes. For example, pustular psoriasis is characterized by blisters filled with pus. Fever, chills, and diarrhea can accompany this type of psoriasis."

According to  California Pacific Medical Center, breast pain affects 50 to 70 percent of  women (CPMC).  The pain is usually categorized as either cyclical or noncyclical. Cyclical pain is  associated with your menstrual cycle, whereas noncyclical pain is not. Pain  linked with the menstrual cycle tends to lessen during or after your period. Noncyclical pain can have many causes, including injury to the breast. Sometimes noncyclical  pain can come from surrounding muscles or tissues rather than the breast  itself. Noncyclical pain is much less common than cyclical pain, and the causes  can be harder to ascertain.Mastalgia can vary in intensity, from a sharp pain to a mild  tingling. Some women may experience breast tenderness, or their breasts may  feel fuller than usual. "

Its cause is often unknown. Acute bacterial prostatitis is caused by a bacterial infection.     It appears suddenly with severe symptoms.A bacterial infection also causes chronic bacterial     prostatitis. It develops more slowly than acute bacterial prostatitis, and     its symptoms tend to be milder but recurring.Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis doesn’t cause     noticeable symptoms."

According to the MayoClinic, a normal range for potassium is between 3.6 and 5.2 millimoles perliter (mmol/L) of blood. A potassium level higher than 5.5 mmol/L is criticallyhigh, and a potassium level over 6.0 mmol/L can be life-threatening.

This condition is often inherited, such as in people with sicklecell anemia or thalassemia. Anyone of any age can develop hemolytic anemia. However,according to the NationalHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), hemolytic anemia seems to affectmore African Americans than Caucasians.

Since then, other strains of bird flu have been identified that also have the ability to cause severe disease and death. Human infections with a new avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013."

If you have HCL, your body produces a surplus of abnormal  B-lymphocytes that do not function properly. These abnormal cells can take up  the space of healthy B-lymphocytes causing a low white blood cell count, which  can weaken the immune system and lead to infections. While the production of abnormal  B-lymphocytes is the hallmark of this disease, the increase production of these  abnormal cells can cause a decrease in red blood cells as well as platelets. HCL  gets its name because the abnormal white blood cells look hairy under a  microscope. Rare cases of hairy cell leukemia affect T-lymphocytes (cells that  help B-lymphocytes fight infection).This  type of cancer affects more men than women, and most HCL diagnoses are made in  people over 50 years of age. According to the National Institutes of Health,  people with HCL will likely live 10 years or longer after diagnosis (NIH, 2012).While  the exact cause of HCL is unknown, some research shows a relationship between  the cancer and exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange, which was used to  destroy crops and jungle canopy during the Vietnam War (IOM, 2009).If  you are a veteran who has HCL and were exposed to Agent Orange during the  Vietnam War, you may qualify for disability and healthcare benefits from the  United States Department of Veterans Affairs."

It can only develop in people who are already infected with hepatitis B.Hepatitis D can be acute or chronic. Acute hepatitis D occurssuddenly and typically causes more severe symptoms. It may go away on its own. Ifthe infection lasts for six months of longer, the condition is known as chronichepatitis D. The long-term version of the infection develops gradually over time.The virus might be present in the body for several months before symptoms occur.As chronic hepatitis D progresses, the chances of complications increase. Manypeople with the condition eventually develop cirrhosis, or severe scarring ofthe liver. There’s currently no cure or vaccine for hepatitis D, but it canbe prevented in people who aren’t already infected with hepatitis B. Treatmentmay also help prevent liver failure when the condition is detected early. "

The PCL  helps keep the knee joint stable, especially the posterior, or back of the  joint. An injury to the PCL could involve straining, spraining, or tearing any  part of that ligament. The PCL is the least commonly injured ligament in the  knee (Orthogate, 2006).A PCL  injury is sometimes referred to as an “overextended knee.”"

      "description": "Insulin resistance means that the cells of the body have become resistant to the action of the hormone insulin. Insulin, secreted by the pancreas, is critical for the body's use of glucose for energy. When the cells of the body do not respond appropriately to insulin, glucose from the bloodstream cannot be taken up by cells and used for fuel. Consequently, the pancreas tries to compensate by producing even more insulin.  When the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels rise. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for the development of diabetes and its associated complications. Insulin resistance is a step in the development of type 2 diabetes and often occurs years before a person develops diabetes. Insulin resistance has been referred to as prediabetes."

      "description": "Your spinal column is made up of a series of bones (vertebrae) stacked ontoeach other. From top to bottom, the column includes seven bones in the cervicalspine, 12 in the thoracic spine, and five in the lumbar spine, followed by thesacrum and the coccyx at the base. These bones are cushioned by disks. Thedisks protect the bones by absorbing the shocks from daily activities likewalking, lifting, and twisting.Each disk has two parts: a soft, gelatinous inner portion and a tough outerring. Injury or weakness can cause the inner portion of the disk to protrudethrough the outer ring. This is known as a slipped, herniated, or prolapseddisk. This causes pain and discomfort. If the slipped disk compresses one ofyour spinal nerves, you may also experience numbness and pain along theaffected nerve. In severe instances, you may require surgery to remove orrepair the slipped disk. "

It’s a rare but serious andpotentially fatal response by your immune system to incompatible blood.These reactions are extremely rare because doctors are aware ofthe danger of using the wrong blood during a transfusion. There are manyprecautions in place to reduce the chances of a mistake. Your doctor and nurse knowwhat symptoms to look for if a reaction does occur during or after your transfusion.This allows them to provide you with treatment as quickly as possible.The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O. If you’re type A,your red blood cells have proteins attached to them known as A antigens. Type Bblood cells carry B antigens. Type AB blood has both A and B antigens, and typeO blood has neither A nor B antigens.Your immune system will produce antibodies against any bloodantigens you don’t have in your own blood. That means people with type A blood createantibodies against B antigens. A person with type A blood receiving atransfusion of type B or AB blood would lead to an ABO incompatibilityreaction. In an ABO incompatibility reaction, your immune system attacks thenew blood cells and destroys them.If you have type AB blood, you have both A and B antigens. Thismeans you’re a universal recipient and you can receive any type of blood.However, you can only donate blood to other people who have type AB blood.If you have type O blood, which has no antigens, you’re auniversal donor. You can give your blood to anyone without triggering theirimmune system, but you can only receive type O blood.Before a blood transfusion, your doctor will test your blood todetermine your blood type. A small sample will be crossmatched with some ofyour donated blood. The two samples of blood are then mixed and viewed under amicroscope. This allows your doctor to be certain an incompatibility reactionwon’t take place."

The iris, the colored ring in your eye, opens and  closes the pupil to adjust the amount of light passing through it. It then  passes through the lens. In its healthiest state, the lens changes shape so it  can bend the rays further and focus them on the retina at the back of the eye. However,  with age, the lenses of your eyes become less flexible and can’t change shape as  easily. As a result, the lens is unable to bend the light properly to focus it  on the retina. "

Acute leukemias are more likely to cause symptoms. Symptoms of all forms of leukemia are related to the proliferation of abnormal blood cells and replacement of the bone marrow by the cancerous cells."

It can be uncomfortable and painful at times. Spasticity occurs when the  nerve impulses that control muscle movement are interrupted or damaged. A  variety of conditions can cause this, including spinal cord injury, brain  injury, and diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple  sclerosis (MS). According to the National MS  Society, spasticity has some benefit for people with very weak legs. The  rigidity from spasticity can help them to stand or walk, (NMSS,  2012). For these people, the goal of treatment should be to relieve pain while  maintaining the rigidity needed to function.Prolonged spasticity can lead  to frozen joints, pressure sores, and an inability to function normally. Make  an appointment with your doctor if you have spasticity with an unknown cause.Stretching exercises can help  relieve spasticity. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy or massage.  Prescription medications for spasticity include muscle relaxants, sedatives,  and nerve blockers. Surgery is used in some cases."

Blood clotscan cause swelling in the veins of your neck or arms, but this is rare.The two types of thrombophlebitis are deep vein thrombosis (DVT) andsuperficial thrombophlebitis. DVT occurs when you develop a blood clot in avein deep in your body. Thrombophlebitis that affects veins closer to thesurface of your skin is known as superficial thrombophlebitis. DVT is alwaysmore serious than superficial thrombophlebitis.You might not notice any major or seemingly serious symptoms ifyou have thrombophlebitis. Minor swelling in the leg or a reddened, tendervein may cause discomfort. This doesn’t mean that it’s safe to ignore thecondition. If DVT isn’t treated, it can lead to a pulmonary embolism (PE), or ablood clot in your lungs. A PE can be life-threatening."

Being  sleepy may be a symptom of fatigue, but it is not the same thing.The  organization also states that fatigue  is a very common symptom for a number of medical conditions—both serious and  non-serious—and also a natural result of some lifestyle choices.  If your fatigue has no apparent cause, and it not going away with proper  rest and nutrition, you should see your doctor.

This can cause the lung to collapse and put pressure on the heart.   The condition ranges in severity. Small pneumothoraxes without  complication can heal on their own in many cases. More serious cases that  involve large volumes of trapped air can become fatal if left untreated.  Treatment can include “watchful waiting” combined with bed rest, insertion of  chest tubes, or more invasive surgical procedures to resolve and prevent  further collapse of the lung.  One or both lungs can collapse after a chest injury or as a result of  underlying lung disease. People who participate in sports such as mountain  climbing or SCUBA diving can experience pneumothorax due to changes in  altitude. The abrupt change of air pressure can cause air blisters to develop  on your lungs and then rupture. The ruptured blisters, called blebs, causes  your lung to collapse.  Sometimes the cause of pneumothorax is unknown. "

Having one or fewer drinks per day for women and two orfewer drinks per day for men is defined as moderate drinking (CDC, 2013).But drinking alcoholtoo much or too often, or being unable to control alcohol consumption, cancause or indicate alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence (also called alcoholism). The NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism says that about 18 million people inthe U.S. struggle with what it terms “alcohol use disorders” (NIAAA). These disorders can be disruptive andlife threatening.Alcohol AbusePeople who abusealcohol may not have a physical dependence on alcohol. But they are morefocused on intoxication than on safely enjoying alcoholic beverages. Abuse canaffect relationships and lead to failure to meet obligations at home, work, orschool. People who abuse alcohol often have legal or financial troubles relatedto their drinking. Long-term alcohol abuse may lead to alcoholism.AlcoholismAlcoholism is likelierto be a physical dependence on alcohol. It is a serious medical condition. Peoplewith alcoholism find drinking moderately or stopping drinking very difficult. Theyoften struggle to live their lives normally. And they may face serious healthconsequences."

      "disease": "shoulder pain",
      "description": "The shoulder has a  wide and versatile range of motion. When something goes wrong with your  shoulder, it hampers your ability to move freely and can cause a great deal of  pain and discomfort. The shoulder is a  ball-and-socket joint that has three main bones: the humerus (long arm bone),  the clavicle (collarbone), and the scapula (also known as the shoulder blade). These  bones are cushioned by a layer of cartilage. There are two main joints: the  acromioclavicular joint, which is located between the highest part of the  scapula (also called the acromion) and the clavicle.the  glenohumeral joint, made up of the top, ball-shaped part of the humerus bone  and the outer edge of the scapula. This joint is also referred to as the shoulder  joint. The shoulder joint  is the most mobile joint in the body. It moves the shoulder forward and backward  and also allows the arm to move in a circular motion, and to move up and away  from the body. Shoulders get their  range of motion from the rotator cuff,  which is made up of four tendons. Tendons are the tissues that connect muscles  to bone. If the tendons or bones around the rotator cuff suffer damage or  swelling, you may find it painful and difficult to lift your arm up over your  head. The shoulder can be  injured by performing manual labor, playing sports, or even by repetitive  movement. Certain diseases can bring about pain that travels to the shoulder,  such as disease of the cervical spine of the neck, as well as liver, heart, or  gallbladder disease. You are more likely  to have problems with your shoulder as you grow older, especially after age 60.  This is because the soft tissues surrounding the shoulder tend to degenerate with  age.In many cases,  shoulder pain can be treated at home. Depending on the cause, physical therapy,  medications, or surgery may be necessary."

Young boys are more likely to have this disease than girls.The prognosis for muscular dystrophy depends on the type and the severityof symptoms. However, most individuals with muscular dystrophy do lose theability to walk and eventually require a wheelchair. There’s no known cure formuscular dystrophies, but certain treatments may help."

A twitch usuallyoccurs in the upper lid, but it can occur in both the upper and lower lids. Formost people, these spasms are very mild and feel like a gentle tug on theeyelid. Others may experience a spasm strong enough that it forces you to closeyour eyelid completely. Some people never have any noticeable signs.Spasms typically occur every few seconds for a minute or two.Episodes of eyelid twitching are unpredictable. The twitch may occur off and onfor several days. Then, you may not experience any twitching for weeks or evenmonths.The twitches are painless and harmless, but they may bother you. Mostspasms will resolve on their own without the need for treatment. In rare cases,eyelid spasms may be an early warning sign of a chronic movement disorder,especially if the spasms are accompanied by other facial twitches oruncontrollable movements."

Height (length) and weight, for instance, are common measures used by your  doctor to determine if your infant is growing normally. Another measure of  infant growth is head circumference, or the size of your baby’s head.  Measurement of your baby’s head size is important because it indicates that  your baby’s brain is growing properly. If your baby’s brain is not growing  properly, he or she may have a condition known as microcephaly.  Microcephaly is a condition in which your baby’s  head is smaller than that of other babies of the same age and gender. This  condition may be present when your baby is born, or it may develop in the first  two years of life. It has no cure. Early diagnosis and treatment, however, can  improve the outlook for your child."

      "description": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare, inherited  metabolic disorder. With MSUD, the body cannot break down certain amino acids.  Individuals who have the disease produce urine that has a distinctive maple  syrup odor.  Amino acids are what remain after your body digests the  protein from the food you eat. Special enzymes process the amino acids so they  can be used to maintain all of your body functions.   If some of the necessary enzymes are missing or defective,  the amino acids and their byproducts, called keto acids, collect in the body.  As the levels of these substances increase, neurological damage, coma, and  life-threatening conditions can result.   In MSUD, the body does not have enzymes from a group called  the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKAD). BCKAD enzymes  process three important amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These are  branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). BCAAs are found in foods like meat, eggs,  and milk, which are rich in protein.  MSUD is also  known as:BCKD deficiencybranched-chain       alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiencyketoacidemiabranched-chain       ketoaciduriabranched-chain       ketonuria I When untreated, MSUD can cause significant physical and  neurological problems. However, MSUD can be controlled with dietary  restrictions. Its success can be monitored with blood tests. Early diagnosis  and intervention improves the chances of long-term success. "

The symptoms vary in intensity. You may have a mild shigellosis infection and  not even realize or report it. Toddlers and preschoolers are more likely to get shigellosis  than older children and adults. This may be because young children put their  fingers in their mouths often and are more likely to ingest the bacteria. The  large number of diaper changes in childcare centers can also increase the  concentration of infection in this age group."

This gives them the flexibility to travel through even  the smallest blood vessels. However, in people with sickle cell, the RBCs have an  abnormal crescent shape. This makes them sticky and rigid. They can get trapped  in small vessels and block blood from reaching different parts of the body.  This can cause pain and tissue damage. Sickle  cell anemia is an autosomal recessive condition. You need two copies of the  gene to have the disease. If you have only one copy of the gene, you are said  to have sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait explains the geographic  distribution of sickle cell disease. It makes you more likely to survive a  malaria infection. That’s why sickle cell is more common in areas that have, or  had, a high prevalence of malaria. "

The vascular system includes blood vesselscalled arteries and veins, which transports blood throughout your body,including your eyes. Your retina requires a constant supply of blood to make sureyour cells get enough nutrients and oxygen. Blood also removes the waste yourretina produces. However, it’s possible for one of the vessels carrying bloodto or from the retina to become blocked or have a blood clot. This is called anocclusion. The occlusion can cause blood or other fluids to build upand prevent the retina from properly filtering light. When light is blocked orfluids are present, a sudden loss of vision can occur. The severity of visionloss may depend on where the blockage or clot occurred. Retinal vascular occlusion is a potentially seriouscondition, especially if hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, alreadyexists. It most often occurs in middle-aged and elderly people. "

For example, an insect or animal bite, toxins found in seafood, amigraine headache, or radiation therapy can give you a feeling of pins andneedles. An abnormal level of vitamin B-12, potassium, calcium or sodium isanother potential cause. Radiation therapy can also produce this odd sensation.Sometimes a specific injury can produce numbness or tingling,such as an injured nerve in your neck or a herniated disk in your spine.Placing pressure on a nerve is a common cause. Carpal tunnel syndrome, scar tissue,enlarged blood vessels, infection, or a tumor can all place pressure on anerve. Likewise, inflammation or swelling of the spinal cord or brain can placepressure on one or more nerves.Some diseases produce numbness or tingling as a symptom. Diabetes,Raynaud’s phenomenon, multiple sclerosis, seizures, hardening of the arteries,or an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) areexamples of this. A stroke or transient ischemic attack (a mini-stroke) areother examples. Damage to the skin via a rash, inflammation, or injury is anotherreason for numbness or tingling.

Cluster headaches can be so  painful that they are sometimes called “suicide headaches.” Cluster  headaches are most common between adolescence and middle age, but they can  occur at any age. Older  studies showed that cluster headaches were more commonly reported by men than  women. A 1998 study published in Cephalagia,  for example, showed that before 1960, men reported cluster headaches six times  more often than men. Over time, however, that gap has shrunk, and by the 1990s,  cluster headaches were found in only twice as many men than women (Manzoni, 1998)."

However, manypeople with the disease don’t know they have it, so this number may actually behigher.The name Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is named for the doctors whoworked on researching this condition in the 1890s. They discovered that issueswith blood clotting don’t cause this condition, which was previously assumed.Instead, this condition is caused by problems with the blood vesselsthemselves.In a healthy circulatory system, there are three types of bloodvessels. There are arteries, capillaries, and veins. Blood moving away fromyour heart is carried through arteries, which travels at a high pressure. Bloodmoving towards your heart is carried through veins, and it travels at a lowerpressure. The capillaries sit between these two types of blood vessels, and thenarrow passageway of your capillaries helps to lower the pressure of the bloodbefore it reaches the veins.People with OWR are missing capillaries in some of their bloodvessels. These abnormal blood vessels are known as arteriovenous malformations(AVM).Because there’s nothing to lower the pressure of the blood beforeit flows into the veins, people with OWR often experience strained veins that mayeventually rupture. When large AVMs occur, hemorrhages can occur. Hemorrhagesin these areas can become life-threatening:the brainthe lungsthe liverthe gastrointestinal tractPeople with OWR also have abnormal blood vessels called“telangiectasias” near the skin and mucosal surfaces. These blood vessels aredilated, or widened, and are often visible as small red dots on the skinsurface."

Itcan also result from physical abuse, sports injuries, or amusement park rides.Whiplashresults when the soft tissues (the muscles and ligaments) of your neck extend beyondthe typical range of motion. Your symptoms might not be apparent for a while,so it’s important to pay attention to any physical changes for a few daysfollowing any accident.Althoughwhiplash is thought of as a relatively mild condition, it can cause long-termpain and discomfort."

This can  include a natural disaster, combat, an assault, physical or sexual abuse, or  other trauma.  PTSD sufferers have a heightened sense of danger and  impending doom. Their natural “fight or flight response” is damaged, causing  them to feel stressed or fearful even in safe situations.  Once called “shell shock” or “battle fatigue,” PTSD has  recently received more public attention because of the high number of war  veterans who have the disorder. However, PTSD can happen to anyone at any age.  PTSD occurs as a response to chemical changes in the brain and is not the  result of a character flaw or weakness. (NIMH)"

      "disease": "multifocal atrial tachycardia and your heart",
      "description": "If you have multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT),  your heart is beating much faster than it normally does. This happens when the  upper chambers of your heart send too many electrical signals to the lower  chambers. It is multifocal, which  means that the signals come from tissue throughout the atria (upper heart  chambers) rather than only from the sinoatrial node.For an adult, a heart rate of 60 to 100 heartbeats  per minute is considered normal. If you have MAT, your heart rate can be  anywhere between 100 and 250 beats per minute. MAT is rare in infants and children. They normally  have higher heart rates than adults—100 to 130 beats per minute. When an infant  or child has MAT, his or her heart rate will be 111 to 253 beats per minute. (Bradley et al.,  2001)    Your heart is comprised of four chambers. The heart’s two  uppermost chambers are called the right atrium and the left atrium; the two  below are called the right ventricle and the left ventricle. The beating of  your heart is stimulated by electrical impulses that begin in an area of the  right atrium known as the sinoatrial node (sinus node or SA node). You could  think of the SA node as your heart’s pacemaker—setting the pace at which your  heart beats. As the electrical signal spreads through the walls of the upper  chambers, it causes them to contract. Before the signal passes through to the  ventricles, it slows to allow the upper chambers to contract before the lower  ones do. According to The Journal of  Emergency Medicine, multifocal atrial  tachycardia (MAT) is not common and is most frequently seen in people with severe  cardiopulmonary (heart-lung) illness."

Congestive heart failure is the failure of the heart muscle to maintain the circulation, leading to a backup of blood in the veins that causes swelling, particularly in the lower parts of the body. Shortness of breath is another common symptom of congestive heart failure that occurs due to fluid buildup in the lungs. Fatigue and a decreased capacity to exercise are other symptoms that commonly result from heart failure. Early symptoms and signs may not be apparent, and symptoms may develop only after the condition has progressed over time."

Your gums may become so swollen, however, that they begin to  hide parts of your teeth. Swollen gums appear red instead of their normal pink.  Swollen gums, also called gingival swelling, often become  irritated, sensitive, and/or painful. You may also notice that your gums bleed  more easily when brushing or flossing your teeth."

Left untreated, these ketone bodies poison you. DKA can occur in people who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but it’s considered more rare in those with type 2. DKA can also appear if you are at risk for diabetes but have notreceived a formal diagnosis. It can be the first sign of type 1 diabetes.DKA is a medical emergency. If you suspect this complication, immediately contact your physician or go to an emergency room.If you have type 1 diabetes and have a glucometer reading of over 300 milligrams per deciliter, you should test your urine for ketones. Call your doctor if moderate or high levels of ketones are present. Always seek medicalhelp if you have unexplained nausea and vomiting. "

It  also removes waste products from the baby’s blood. The placenta is also  referred to as “afterbirth,” for it exits the body after the baby is born. During pregnancy, the placenta moves as the  uterus stretches and grows. It is very normal for the placenta to be low in the  uterus in early pregnancy. But as the pregnancy continues, the placenta  typically moves to the top of the uterus. By the third trimester, the placenta  should be near the top of the womb, so the cervix has a clear path for  delivery. If the placenta attaches to the lower part of the uterus, it  can cover part or all of the cervix (the entrance to the womb). When the  placenta covers part or all of the cervix during the last months of pregnancy,  this is a condition known as placenta previa, or low-lying placenta. This  condition can cause severe bleeding before or during labor. There are four types of placenta previa, ranging from minor  to major (in which the placenta is covering the entire opening of the cervix).  Depending on the type, a woman with placenta previa may need to have a Cesarean  (C-section) delivery. Most women with this condition will require bed rest. "

      "disease": "orthostatic hypotension",
      "description": "Orthostatic hypotension (also called postural hypotension) is a sudden fall in blood pressure thatoccurs upon standing quickly. Blood pressure is the force of your blood againstthe walls of your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart throughthe body). Hypotension is the termfor low blood pressure.When you stand up, gravity pulls blood into your legs, andyour blood pressure begins to fall. Certain reflexes in your body compensatefor this change. Your heart beats faster to pump more blood, and your bloodvessels constrict to prevent blood from pooling in your legs. Many drugs canaffect these normal reflexes and lead to orthostatic hypotension. Thesereflexes may also begin to weaken as we age. For this reason, orthostatichypotension is common in the elderly. People with orthostatic hypotension feel dizzy when theystand up. The condition is often mild and lasts for just a few minutes afterstanding. Some people may faint (temporarily lose consciousness)."

Phenylalanine is found in all proteins and in some artificial  sweeteners. Your body uses the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase to convert  phenylalanine to tyrosine, a nonessential amino acid. Tyrosine is necessary for  your body to make neurotransmitters like epinephrine, norepinephrine, and  dopamine.  Without  treatment for PKU, phenylalanine would build up in your body, and the buildup  would cause damage to your nervous system and brain.  According  to the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s Genetic Home Reference (NLM),  the occurrence of PKU varies among ethnic groups worldwide. It is rare in the  United States—just one in every 10,000 to 15,000 newborns will have PKU (NLM).   Prompt  identification of the disorder and a commitment to lifelong dietary  modifications can treat the effects of PKU and prevent brain damage. (NLM) For this reason, all newborns in the U.S. are  screened for PKU."

It is a serious and embarrassing  disorder, which can lead to social isolation.  Stress incontinence typically occurs when certain kinds of physical movement  puts pressure on your bladder. Laughing, sneezing, coughing, jumping, vigorous  exercise, and heavy lifting can all cause stress incontinence. Any pressure  placed on the abdomen and bladder can lead to the loss of urine. It’s important to remember that the term  “stress” is used in a strictly physical sense when describing stress  incontinence. Emotional stress is not a factor in this type of urinary disorder.  The “stress” refers to excessive pressure on the bladder.An important distinction is that between overactive bladder  and stress incontinence. Overactive bladder is a separate condition. In some  cases both overactive bladder occurs with stress incontinence and is called  mixed incontinence. Your doctor can do  tests to determine which one is the cause of your incontinence."

      "description": "Skin flushing, or blushing, describes feelings of warmth andrapid reddening of your neck, upper chest, or facial region. Blotchiness orsolid patches of redness are often visible when blushing. Flushed skin is acommon physical response to anxiety, stress, embarrassment, anger, or anotherextreme emotional state. Facial flushing is usually more of a social worry thana medical concern.However, flushing may be linked to an underlying medicalissue, such as Cushing’s disease or a niacin overdose. Cushing’s disease is aresult of high levels of cortisol in the body. A niacin overdose is due totaking too much over-the-counter niacin medication to lower your cholesterol. Theseare just two potential causes of flushing — be sure to check with your doctorif you have recurring skin flushing or blushing.Common Underlying Causes of Facial FlushingFlushing happens as a result of increased blood flow.Whenever there is more blood flow to an area of skin (such as your cheeks), theblood vessels enlarge to compensate. This enlargement is what gives skin the“flushed” effect. There are many specific causes of facial flushing, such as aheightened emotional state or eating spicy food. Several medical conditions arealso linked to skin flushing. Listed below are some common causes of flushing.Spicy FoodsConsuming spicy foods, such as peppers or products derivedfrom the Capsicum (pepper)genus of plants, can cause sudden redness in the face or neck. These includecayenne pepper, paprika, chili peppers, and red peppers. Eating these foods mayraise your body temperature, increasing blood flow and causing facial redness. Handlingthese types of foods can also cause skin redness and irritation.Emotional TriggersExtreme emotions can trigger redness in the face. Forexample, if you become deeply embarrassed or anxious, your face or neck mayappear splotchy. Experiencing feelings of extreme anger, stress, or sadness mayalso cause skin flushing. Crying can often cause red blotches on the face andneck. All of these emotions can also coincide with an acute increase in bloodpressure — still, high blood pressure itself is not a cause of flushing, according to the American Heart Association.RosaceaRosacea is a skin condition that may produce swelling,redness, and acne-like sores. While the cause of rosacea is unknown,inflammation of the blood vessels from stress, spicy foods, and hottemperatures may worsen the condition. Fair-skinned females between the ages of30 and 50 are the most susceptible.Other CausesOther, less common causes of facial blushing include:alcohol consumptionhigh temperatures or feverreactions to medications, particularly too muchniacin (vitamin B-3)Cushing’s diseasemenopausecarcinoid syndromeWhen to Visit Your DoctorThough flushing typically isn’t an emergency, it may belinked to serious medical conditions. Talk to your doctor if your flushingbecomes a persistent issue or if it occurs with other symptoms, such asdiarrhea.Your doctor will likely want to take an inventory of yoursymptoms to determine the underlying cause of your flushing. They may ask youabout the frequency, duration, location, and context of your symptoms. Also, amedical exam and history will help supply required information for your doctorto make a diagnosis. Be sure to mention other co-occurring symptoms, such asdiarrhea, shallow breathing, or hives, so that your doctor may evaluate them.If your provider finds that your symptoms are emotionally based,they may refer you to a psychotherapist. These professionals can help byteaching you skills to help you cope with extreme emotional events and soprevent flushing.Addressing and Easing Your SymptomsThere are several home health options available to help youdecrease your flushing episodes. If home health options don’t prevent or lessenthe frequency of these episodes, see your doctor immediately. It may mean thatyou have an underlying medical condition causing this sudden redness.Home Health OptionsHome health options include avoiding specific triggers, suchas spicy foods, hot beverages, toxins, bright sunlight, and extreme cold orheat. Removing yourself from high-stress situations may also help preventflushing. Employing relaxation tactics, such as deep breathing exercises, toreduce anxiety may help lower your blood pressure. If your flushing doesn’tsubside, make an appointment with your doctor.What Are the Consequences of Untreated Flushing?Flushing does not commonly result in serious medicalproblems. However, in some instances, a serious condition can be the underlyingcause of flushing. It’s important to talk to your doctor about all of yoursymptoms.Also, pinpointing your triggers can help prevent bouts offlushing. If your trigger is emotional, flushing can become more prevalent ifyou don’t develop adequate coping skills to help manage your emotions.How to Prevent FlushingThere is no definitive method for preventing flushing.However, there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of these episodes.You can:limit your alcohol consumption (people whose enzymeto help break down alcohol is inactive are more prone to redness and warmth onthe skin after drinking an alcoholic beverage)limit your handling and eating of spicy foods,especially those derived from the Capsicum genustry to avoid extreme temperatures and excessivebright sunlightlimit your niacin intake to the daily recommended allowance of 14 to 18 milligrams for adults,unless your doctor tells you differently (consuming more than 50 milligrams ofniacin can cause flushing)employ coping skills to regulate extremeemotions, such as anxietyHelpful coping skills include relaxation techniques andcognitive behavioral skills. Also, hypnosis may be effective in treating someemotional issues that produce flushing.OutlookIn many cases, occasional flushing is more of a hassle thanit is a medical concern. Taking preventive steps to address your flushing canbe very helpful in reducing your symptoms. However, it’s important to seekimmediate medical care for unusual symptoms of flushing. You should also seeyour doctor for recurring episodes.  "

Occasionally, however, surgery  is needed.   Untreated  apnea can also lead to heart and brain problems due to a lack of oxygen. "

If the cells of the body are not using insulin well, or if the body is unable to make any or enough insulin, sugar builds up in the blood. Symptoms include excessive thirst, hunger, and urination; fatigue; slow-healing sores or cuts; and blurry vision. If diabetes develops quickly, as happens with type 1 diabetes, people may also experience quick weight loss. If diabetes develops slowly, as in type 2 diabetes, people may not be diagnosed until symptoms of longer-term problems appear, such as a heart attack or pain, numbness, and tingling in the feet.Long-term complications of diabetes can include kidney failure, nerve damage, and blindness."

Neurodegenerative diseases cause the brain and nerves todeteriorate over time, resulting in a gradual loss of neurological function. Neurocognitive disorders can alsodevelop as a result of brain trauma or substance abuse. Healthcare providerscan usually determine the underlying cause of neurocognitive disorders based on the reported symptoms andthe results of diagnostic tests. The cause and severity of neurocognitive disorders can helphealthcare providers determine the best course of treatment.The long-term outlook for people with neurocognitive disorders depends on the cause.

Your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs about thesize of a closed fist. They’re located on either side of your spine, near themiddle of your back. Your kidneys filter and clean your blood — every day,about 200 quarts of blood pass through your kidneys. The clean blood returns toyour circulatory system. Waste products and extra fluid become urine. The urineis sent to the bladder and eventually removed from your body.The damage caused by MCKD leads the kidneys to produce urine that is notconcentrated enough. In other words, your urine is essentially too watery, andlacks the proper amount of waste. As a result, you’ll end up urinating way morefluid than normal (polyuria) as your body tries to get rid of all the extrawaste. And when the kidneys produce too much urine, then water, sodium, andother vital chemicals are lost. Over time, MCKD can lead to kidney failure."

According to the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 25million Americans suffer from asthma. It’s the most common chronic conditionamong American children. About one in every 10 children has asthma.To understand asthma, you need to understand a little aboutwhat happens when you breathe. Normally, with every breath you take, air goesthrough your nose and down into your throat, eventually making it to yourlungs. There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliveroxygen from the air into your bloodstream. Asthma symptoms occur when thelining of these air passages swell and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus thenfills the airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through. Theseconditions then bring on an asthma “attack” — the coughing and tightnesstypical of asthma."

The pain usually improves with rest.It can also affect the vessels that supply bloodand oxygen to your:armsstomach and intestineskidneysIn PVD, blood vessels become narrowed andblood flow decreases. This can be due to arteriosclerosis, or “hardening of thearteries,” or it can be caused by blood vessel spasms. In arteriosclerosis,plaques build up in a vessel and limit the flow of blood and oxygen to your organsand limbs. As plaque growth progresses, clots maydevelop and completely block the artery. This can lead to organ damage and lossof fingers, toes, or limbs, if left untreated.Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) develops only in the arteries, which carry oxygen-richblood away from the heart. According to the CDC, approximately 12 to 20 percentof people over age 60 develop PAD, about 8.5 million people in theUnited States. PAD is the most common form of PVD, so the terms are often usedto mean the same condition.

The rash that occurs is referred to as erythema migrans. It develops in about 70% of people who get Lyme disease. It starts at the site of the tick bite and expands over the next several days. It can eventually cover an area up to about 12 inches across. Some of the area may clear, giving the rash at times a bull's-eye appearance. The rash may feel warm to the touch, but it is usually not painful and does not itch. Some people get generalized symptoms in this stage as well, such as fever, chills, headache, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes. Some people may have only the generalized symptoms without developing a rash."

About 15percent of people in the U.S. have tried cocaine (National Institute on DrugAbuse [NIDA]). Cocaine is also known as coke, C,flake, snow, crack, or blow. It is derived from the coca plant, which is nativeto South America.Cocaine is astimulant. It primarily impacts the brain, leading to feelings of extroversionand euphoria. Addiction to cocaine can develop very quickly, even with minimaluse. An addiction can be both physical, meaningthat the user’s body craves the drug, and mental, meaning that the userstrongly desires the effects of the cocaine. Habitualcocaine use can lead to psychiatric disorders.Cocaine can be consumedin a variety of ways: for example, it can be inhaled through the nose, injectedinto a vein, or taken orally. Cocaine can also be smoked after being processedinto what’s known as crack cocaine. Addiction can occur quickly from any ofthese methods."

Survival rates for this cancer depend on itsspecific location and how early it’s diagnosed. According to the AmericanCancer Society (ACS), 90 percent of people with stage 1 cancers of theglottis survive for five years or more. The glottis is the part of the larynxthat contains the vocal cords. In contrast, 59 percent of people with stage 1cancer of the structures above the glottis, or supraglottis, survive for fiveyears or longer. The supraglottis contains the epiglottis, which closes off thelarynx when you swallow. It keeps food from entering your lungs."

It’s considered chronic when it keeps coming back or when theinflammation doesn’t heal for months or years. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to permanent scarring and damage. Calciumstones and cysts may develop in your pancreas, which can block the duct, ortube, that carries digestive enzymes and juices to your stomach.

This is a very important enzyme, or protein,that regulates various biochemical reactions in the body. G6PD is alsoresponsible for keeping red blood cells healthy so they can function properlyand live a normal life span. Without enough of it, red blood cells break downprematurely. This early destruction of red blood cells is known as hemolysis,and it can eventually to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia develops when redblood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them, resulting inreduced oxygen flow to the organs and tissues. This can cause fatigue,yellowing of the skin and eyes, and shortness of breath. In people with G6PDdeficiency, hemolytic anemia can occur after eating fava beans or certainlegumes. It may also be triggered by infections or by certain drugs, such as:antimalarials, a type of medication used toprevent and treat malariasulfonamides, a medication used for treating variousinfectionsaspirin, a drug used for relieving fever, pain,and swellingsome nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications(NSAIDs)G6PD deficiency is most prevalent inAfrica, where it can affect up to 20 percentof individuals. The condition is also more common in men than in women. Most people with G6PD deficiencyusually don't experience any symptoms. However, some may develop symptoms whenthey’re exposed to the medication, food, or infection that triggers the earlydestruction of red blood cells. Once the underlying cause is treated orresolved, symptoms of G6PD deficiency usually disappear within a few weeks."

If you  have folic acid deficiency anemia during pregnancy, your baby may be at a  higher risk of developing serious birth defects, such as spina bifida. Spina  bifida causes the baby’s spinal column to be  malformed.   If  you are folic acid deficient, taking supplements to increase your folic acid level  can reduce your risk of developing anemia.

A hyphema is usually caused by trauma to the eye and is  accompanied by an increase in intraocular  pressure (the pressure inside the eye). However, it may appear without  warning in children who have other medical conditions such as sickle cell  anemia or hemophilia. Immediate medical attention is needed if a hyphema occurs.  The best way to prevent hyphema is to wear eye protection when playing sports.  Also, never take an eye injury lightly. Even if there is no bleeding, you  should check with your eye doctor. "

Other names for this condition include abusive head trauma,  shaken impact syndrome, whiplash shake syndrome, and inflicted head injury.  Shaken baby syndrome is a form of child abuse that causes severe brain damage.  It can result from as few as five seconds of shaking. Babies have soft brains and weak neck muscles. They also have  delicate blood vessels. Shaking a baby or young child can cause his or her  brain to repeatedly hit the inside of the skull. This impact can trigger  bruising of the brain, bleeding in the brain, and brain swelling. Other  injuries can include damage to a baby’s eyes, spine, and neck as well as broken  bones. Shaken baby syndrome is more common in children under the age of  2 but can occur in children as old as 5. Newborns and babies may sometimes fall  off of a bed or down the stairs. These incidents rarely result in shaken baby  syndrome. This condition does not result from bouncing a baby on the lap or  playfully tossing a baby in the air. It is a serious and deliberate form of  abuse. If you believe that your baby or another baby is a victim of  shaken baby syndrome, call 911 right away. This condition is life threatening  and requires immediate medical attention."

It is released when you  exhale. There are two major types of lung cancer—small cell lung  cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is much  more aggressive than nonsmall cell lung cancer. In SCLC, the cells grow quickly  and spread to other parts of the body. There are two kinds of SCLC—oat cell  cancer (also called small cell carcinoma) and combined small cell carcinoma. Oat  cell cancer is diagnosed more frequently than combined small cell carcinoma.Unfortunately, SCLC is an aggressive form of cancer that is  usually only caught after it has spread through the body.

The placenta then begins to peel away from the uterine wall so that it can leave the body following the path the baby just took. Sometimes, the placenta begins to peel away from the uterus too soon, while the baby still needs the placenta to supply oxygen and nutrients. This is called placental abruption or just abruption.Doctors aren't sure exactly how placental abruption occurs. Many believe, however, that tiny blood vessels on the surface of the placenta begin to leak and form a bruise or blood blister, which then spreads between the placenta and the uterine wall. The blood loosens the connection between the uterine wall and the placenta, allowing it to separate."

They are linked by lymphatic  vessels, which carry lymph (a clear  fluid containing white blood cells) and dead and diseased tissue for disposal) throughout  the body. The primary function of lymph nodes is to harbor the body’s disease-fighting  cells.   When you are sick and your lymph nodes send  out disease-fighting cells and compounds, they may become inflamed or painful.  The condition of having inflamed lymph nodes is referred to as lymphadenitis.  Lymph node inflammation can occur for a  variety of reasons. Any infection or virus, including the common cold, can  cause your lymph nodes to swell. Cancer–including blood cancer–can also cause  lymph node inflammation."

Sometimes called sun spots or age spots,  the correct term for this condition is actinic keratosis. The spots themselves  are called actinic keratoses.  Actinic keratosis (AK) is a very  common skin condition. It occurs when skin cells called keratinocytes start to  grow abnormally, forming scaly discolored spots. The skin patches may be brown,  tan, grey, or pink. They tend to appear on the parts of the body that get the  most sun exposure such as the hands, arms, face, scalp, and neck.  AK may actually be in situ stage squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lesions. “In situ” means the lesions are  confined to one location and not invading other tissue. In most cases, AK  lesions are relatively benign. However, each lesion has about a 10 percent  chance of progressing into an invasive form of SCC. Because of this risk, the  spots should be monitored regularly for any suspicious changes."

When they do produce symptoms, they are the typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Heartburn, regurgitation, and nausea are common symptoms. Other symptoms can include chest pain or burning and difficulty swallowing. A bloated feeling after meal consumption and shortness of breath sometimes occur."

The consequences and treatments vary greatly,depending on what caused your head injury and how severe it is.Head injuries may be either closedor open. A closed head injury is any injury that doesn’t break your skull. Anopen, or penetrating, head injury is one in which something breaks your skulland enters your brain. It can be hard to assess howserious a head injury is just by looking. Some minor head injuries bleed a lot,while some major injuries don’t bleed at all. It’s important to treat all headinjuries seriously and get them assessed by a doctor."

Occasionally one of the vessels can burst.  Even a tiny amount of blood can spread out a lot in the narrow space and can  make the condition appear quite alarming. As the conjunctiva only covers  the white of your eye, the central area of the eye (the cornea) is not  affected. Your cornea is responsible for your sight, so any bleeding under the  conjunctiva should not affect your vision.In addition to covering the sclera, the conjunctiva also  lines the insides of your eyelids. It contains many tiny glands that secrete  fluid to protect and lubricate your eye.Blood under the conjunctiva is not a dangerous condition. It  usually goes away on its own within a few weeks."

Sepsis is when inflammation throughout the bodyoccurs. This inflammation can cause blood clots and block oxygen from reachingvital organs, resulting in organ failure. The NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) estimates that over 1 million Americans getsevere sepsis each year. Between 28 and 50 percent of these patients may diefrom the condition.

According to the National Library of Medicine (NLM), this bacterium  is the most common cause of traveler’s diarrhea, a condition that is marked by  loose stools, abdominal cramping, nausea, and bloating. (NLM,  2011)  There are many strains of E. coli, some of which are harmless. In fact, hundreds of strains  live in the digestive tract as “good” bacteria. However, certain toxic strains  may lead to serious illness. If you are exposed to a toxic strain, you  can develop food poisoning and enteritis. This infection is sometimes called  traveler’s diarrhea because when you travel you are exposed to new strains of E. coli that you may react negatively  to.   Some strains are more dangerous than others. They produce a  toxin called Shiga, or verocytotoxin, which causes severe illness and bleeding  that can be fatal, especially in children. Shiga-producing toxic E. coli (often called “STEC” for short)  may also be referred to as E.coli 0157. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an  estimated 265,000 STEC infections occur each year in the U.S. (CDC, 2011)"

      "disease": "stasis dermatitis and ulcers",
      "description": "Stasis dermatitis is skin inflammation that develops in peoplewith poor circulation. It most often occurs in the lower legs because that’swhere blood typically collects. When blood collects or pools in the veins of your lower legs, thepressure on the veins increases. The increased pressure damages yourcapillaries, which are very small blood vessels. This allows proteins to leakinto your tissues. This leakage leads to a buildup of blood cells, fluid, andproteins, which causes your legs to swell. This swelling is called peripheral edema.People with stasis dermatitis usually experience swollen legs andfeet, open sores, or itchy and reddish skin. A protein called fibrinogen may beresponsible for the changes you see in your skin. When fibrinogen leaks intoyour tissues, your body converts it to the active form of the protein, which iscalled fibrin. As it leaks out, the fibrin surrounds your capillaries, formingwhat are known as fibrin cuffs. According to the ClevelandClinic, these fibrin cuffs may prevent oxygen from entering your tissues.When your cells don’t receive enough oxygen, they can become damaged and die."

Usually,they’re not discovered until you are tested for an unrelated condition — thisis called an “incidental finding.” Skin hemangiomas appear as small scratcheson babies and grow larger as the child ages. However, most hemangiomas of theskin disappear by the age of 10.Hemangiomas are usually small, but in some cases they maygrow large, or develop lesions and require removal.

The job of these nerves is to deliver signals  about physical sensations back to your brain. Peripheral neuropathy is a disorder that occurs when these  nerves malfunction because they are damaged or destroyed. This disrupts the  nerves’ normal functioning. They might send signals of pain when there is  nothing causing pain, or they might not send a pain signal even if something is  harming you. This can be caused by injury, systemic illness, infection, or may  be associated with an inherited disorder. The disorder is uncomfortable, but treatments can be very  helpful. The most important thing to determine is whether peripheral neuropathy is  caused by a serious underlying condition. "

The CDC also reports that gonorrhea is the second most common  bacterial STI in the United States (CDC, 2011). Treatment for gonorrhea is effective  and available. However, many cases go untreated.   Over time, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread to the  bloodstream and to other parts of the body.

The World Health Organization (WHO) implemented a strict vaccinationstandard in order to slow the infection rate. The last known natural caseoccurred in 1977 in Somalia.By1980, the WHOdeclared that smallpox had been completely eradicated, although government andhealth agencies still have stashes of smallpox virus for research purposes.

Without treatment, Christmasdisease can be fatal.A person is born with Christmas disease, but it may not bediagnosed until later in life. It’s estimated that two-thirdsof cases are inherited.

The top of each ureter is found in the middle of the kidney in an area  known as the renal pelvis. Urine  collects in the renal pelvis and is drained by the ureter into the bladder.   The renal pelvis  and the ureter are lined with specific types of cells called transitional cells. These cells are  able to bend and stretch without breaking apart. When cancer develops in the  renal pelvis or ureter, it begins in the transitional cells.  This type of  cancer is known as malignant neoplasm of the ureter. It is more commonly called  transitional cell cancer. Neoplasm is another word for tumor or cancer.  In many  instances, transitional cell cancer metastasizes. Metastasis occurs  when cancer from one organ or part of the body spreads to another organ or part  of the body. "

      "description": "Spinal cord abscess (SCA) is a rare condition capable of  causing permanent damage to the spinal cord. Abscesses are caused when injured  tissue becomes infected. The body’s immune system sends white blood cells to  help fight off the infection. They begin to fill the damaged tissue, causing  pus to build up. Pus is made up of the dying tissue, immune cells, dead cells,  and bacteria.   The cause of SCA is generally due to the introduction of  bacteria into the spinal cord. Once inside the body, it is able to find a place  to live and grow. The pressure of the abscess on the spinal cord will sometimes  cause neurological problems, such as lower-body paralysis and loss of sensation  below the area of the abscess.  Doctors will try to find the presence of an infection by  testing body fluids. They may also look at an image of the abscess. Once the  diagnosis is confirmed, they will have to either drain or remove the abscess.  Patients will generally receive antibiotics to take after they leave to avoid  getting an infection.   Since antibiotics have come into common medical use, SCA has  become extremely rare. In fact, fewer than 100 cases have been reported in  modern medical history (Oskouian, 2012)."

It’s a syndrome,which is a collection of symptoms that occur together. Although many peoplethink of it as an arthritic condition due to the symptoms, it’s not a type ofarthritis. The condition is often associated with tender points, which are termed “triggerpoints.” These are places on the body where even light pressure causespain. According to standards published by the American College of Rheumatologyin 1990, a person can be diagnosed with fibromyalgia if they have widespreadpain and tenderness in at least 11 of the known 18 trigger points.  Common trigger points include:the back of the headtops of shouldersupper chesthipskneesouter elbowsA consistent dull ache through the entire body is alsocommon. People with this disorder may also have:fatiguetrouble sleepingheadachesdepressionanxietyAlthough the causes are unclear, fibromyalgia flare-upscan be the result of stress, physical trauma, or an apparently unrelatedsystemic illness like the flu. Symptoms may be a result of the brain and nervesmisinterpreting or overreacting to normal pain signals. This could be possiblydue to an imbalance in brain chemicals."

Arthritis is a long-term condition characterized by stiffness,swelling, and pain in the joints. An estimated 300,000children in the United States have a form of arthritis. Some children havearthritis for just a few months, while others have arthritis for several years.In rare cases, the condition can last a lifetime.The exact cause of JRA isn’t known. However, researchers believeit might be an autoimmune disease. In people with autoimmune diseases, theimmune system can’t differentiate between the healthy cells in the body and harmfulsubstances, such as viruses and bacteria. This causes the immune system tomistakenly attack harmless cells as though they are dangerous invaders. Inchildren with JRA, the immune system releases chemicals that damage healthytissues in the body, causing inflammation and pain in the joints.Most cases of JRA are mild, but severe cases may result in complications,such as joint damage and chronic pain. Knowing the symptoms of JRA is importantfor getting treatment before the condition progresses. Treatment usually consists of controlling pain,improving function, and preventing joint damage. This can help make sure your child maintains an active,productive lifestyle."

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders  and Stroke (NINDS), low back pain is the second most common neurological  problem in the U.S., and Americans spend an average of $50 billion per year  treating low back pain. (NINDS, 2012)   Most low back pain is the result of an injury,  such as muscle sprains or strains due to sudden movements or poor body  mechanics while lifting heavy objects. But low back pain can also be caused by  certain diseases, such as cancer of the spinal cord, ruptured or herniated disc,  sciatica, arthritis, kidney infections, or infections of the spine. Acute back  pain can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, while chronic back pain  is pain that lasts longer than three months.   Lower back pain is more likely to occur in  individuals between the ages of 30 and 50. This is partly due to the changes  that occur in the body with aging. As you grow older, the fluid content between  the vertebrae in the spine becomes reduced, which means discs in the spine are  more easily irritated. Some muscle tone  is also lost, which makes the back more prone to injury. This is why  strengthening your back muscles and using good body mechanics are helpful in  preventing lower back pain."

It includes:hemolysis EL: elevated liver enzymesLP: a low platelet countHemolysis refers to a breakdown of red blood  cells. Specifically, red blood cells get broken down earlier than normal. Hemolysis  can lead to anemia, a condition in which your blood does not have enough oxygen  to supply your body.Elevated liver enzymes indicate that your liver is  functioning poorly. When liver cells are inflamed or injured, they leak  abnormally high amounts of certain chemicals, including enzymes, into your  blood.Platelets are part of the blood that helps it clot.  When they are low, you are at risk for excess bleeding.   HELLP  syndrome usually occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, before the 37th  week. It is a major health concern because it can be fatal to both mother and  unborn baby. Prompt treatment and delivery of the baby are generally required  for the best outcome. However, about a third of HELLP cases occur after the  baby is born in the first week after delivery (Padden, 1999).  The  syndrome’s cause is unknown. Some experts believe it is related to  preeclampsia, another pregnancy complication, which causes high blood pressure.  There are certain factors that can also increase your chance of developing  HELLP syndrome.  According to the  National Institutes of Health, HELLP syndrome affects approximately one to two  out of every 1,000 pregnant women. (NIH). "

For most people, body movements are smooth, coordinated, and seamless.  Such things as walking, throwing a ball, and picking up a pencil are effortless  for most of us. But each movement actually involves a number of muscle groups.  They are largely controlled by the cerebellum. This is an important  structure in the brain. When communication between the brain and the rest of the body is  disrupted in some way, ataxia may be the result. Movements appear jerky and  unsteady. A person with ataxia may also have an unsteady walk or a tendency to  stumble while walking. He or she may have problems with everyday tasks that  require fine motor skills. These tasks include such seemingly simple things as  eating or using a pen to write. Ataxia can have a profound effect on a person’s  life. "

In more serious cases of gum disease, there is damage to the soft tissues and bones that support the teeth (periodontitis), leading to separation of the teeth from the gums.

A sprain occurs when your ligaments (the tissues that connectbones) tear or get overstretched.Most ankle sprains are lateral sprains, which occur whenyour foot rolls, causing your outside ankle to twist toward the ground. Thisaction stretches or rips the ligaments. A sprained ankle often swells andbruises for about seven to fourteen days. However, it may take a few months fora severe injury to heal fully.Once healed, the sprained ankle is sometimes permanentlyweaker and less stable than the other ankle. According to a paper published bythe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the greatest risk factor forankle sprain is having a previous ankle sprain. "

This createsmany areas for a potential problem. Bladder and kidney health, obstructions,and muscle problems can all lead to OAB.OAB affects millions of people worldwide. According to the National Association for Continence(NAFC), one in five adults over the age of 40 are affected by OAB or recurrent symptomsof urgency and frequency. Eighty-five percent of these peopleare women. In addition, one in four women experience urine leakage at one timeor another.  Although OAB is relatively common, many people don’t talkabout it. The embarrassing nature of OAB means it’s something that people wouldrather keep quiet. In many cases, the cause of OAB is unknown. Thegood news is that several treatment options are available even when the causecan’t be determined."

It most often affects the scalp, but it can also develop in oilyareas of the body, such as the face, upper chest, and back. When infantsdevelop this condition, it’s known as crib cap. It typicallydevelops within the first few weeks of life and gradually disappears overseveral weeks or months. The exact cause of seborrheic eczema isn’t known. However,doctors believe there are two main factors that can contribute to thedevelopment of the condition. The first factor is an overproduction of oil. Anexcess amount of oil in the skin might act as an irritant, causing the skin tobecome red and greasy. The second contributing factor is Malassezia, which is a type of fungus that’s naturally found in theskin’s oils. It can sometimes grow abnormally, causing the skin to secrete moreoil than usual. The increased production of oil can lead to seborrheic eczema. The condition might also develop in infants due to hormonalchanges that occur in the mother during pregnancy. The fluctuating hormonelevels are believed to stimulate the infant's oil glands, leading to anoverproduction of oil that may irritate the skin. Seborrheic eczema is a long-term skin condition that requiresongoing treatment. However, developing a good skin care routine and learning torecognize and eliminate triggers can help you manage the condition effectively."

Cells called  lymphocytes are part of the lymph system and can travel through the central  nervous system. When they become cancerous, they can cause cancer in these  tissues.Primary cerebral  lymphoma is a rare cancer that starts in the lymph tissues of the brain or  spinal cord. It is called primary cerebral lymphoma when it starts in the  central nervous system, as opposed to when it spreads to the brain from  somewhere else. In some cases, it can also start in the eye. Without treatment, individuals with this cancer typically  die within two months. Those who receive treatment usually live at least three  or four more years, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMM, 2011). "

Over time, however, the condition worsens until every movement of the  eye irritates the surface of the cornea. Without treatment, this continuous  abrasion can cause eye infections and scarring of the eyeball. With a serious  case, you can lose sight in the affected eye.Entropion is  a common condition among the elderly. The lower eyelid is most often affected,  and it can occur in one or both eyes. Treatment involves a relatively simple  surgery that can be performed in the doctor’s office."

Amino acids are  essential building blocks that are responsible for creating protein in the  body. This inherited condition is an autosomal recessive trait. This means that  people who are born with the condition have inherited a mutated gene from both  parents. The disease was  named for the Hartnup family of England, who were looked at in a 1956 study of  the disease (Sekulovic, 2011). Four of eight family members were found to  have excessive amounts of amino acids in their urine, skin rash, and ataxia  (lack of coordination of voluntary muscle movements). These signs and symptoms  are characteristic of Hartnup disease, which affects the skin and the brain. Hartnup disease is a  relatively rare disorder, occurring in one per 24,000 births in North America  and Australia (Sekulovic, 2011). Rare as it is, Hartnup disease may be the  most common amino acid disorder in humans. The condition  normally begins to show symptoms in infancy or in the first few years of a  child’s life. It causes “attacks” of symptoms. The attacks last for about two  weeks and the frequency of attacks decreases as the child grows older."

In many cases, the cause of the  condition is unknown. It can produce uncomfortable symptoms such as burning  during urination, a frequent need to urinate, and pain in the lower back.   When chronic  prostatitis is caused by a bacterial infection, it can be treated with  antibiotics. When the cause is unknown, treatment of the symptoms may be the  best course of action. Even when the condition cannot be cured, men who receive  treatment for chronic prostatitis are usually able to find relief from  symptoms. "

It is also found in oats that have been processed in plants  that handle other grains. Gluten can be found in some medicines, vitamins, and  lipsticks.In celiac disease, the immune reaction to gluten creates  toxins. These damage the villi, which are tiny finger-like protrusions inside  the small intestines. Damage to them decreases the body’s ability to absorb  nutrients. This leads to malnutrition.  Treating celiac disease basically means eliminating all dietary  gluten. This means avoiding most bread products, cakes and cookies, beer, and  even products like ice cream where gluten is sometimes used as a stabilizing  ingredient."

Those who were affected developed a form of pneumonia that eventuallybecame known as Legionnaires’ disease.Legionella bacteria usually thrive in warm water. Peoplebecome infected with Legionella by breathing in contaminateddroplets of water in the air. Outbreaks have been linked to water systems inhospital buildings and to whirlpool spas in hotels and cruise ships.Approximately 8,000 to 18,000 peopleare hospitalized in the United States each year for Legionnaires’ disease. However,the number of infections is probably higher because many infections aren’tdiagnosed or reported. Some cases are so mild that affected individuals never seektreatment. The symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease are similar to those of othertypes pneumonia. These symptoms may include fever, chills, and a cough.Many people who are exposed to Legionella don’t becomesick. When illness does occur, however, it’s important to see a doctor rightaway. Legionnaires’ disease is a serious, life-threatening illness thatrequires prompt treatment. Legionella may also cause a more mild conditionreferred to as Pontiac fever.Pontiac fever doesn’t cause pneumonia and isn’t life-threatening. It hassymptoms similar to those of a mild flu, and it usually goes away on its own.Pontiac fever and Legionnaire’s disease are sometimes collectively called Legionellosis."

If this process is altered, bones  can break down and re-form abnormally and in ways that compromise the integrity  of the skeleton.Paget’s disease of the bone, also called osteitis deformans,  is a chronic condition that affects the skeleton. It commonly affects older adults.  According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the condition  occurs in three to four percent of those over 50 years old (AAOS, 2007). In this disease, abnormal breakdown of bone occurs with  subsequent abnormal bone formation. The new bone that is formed is significantly  oversized, weak, and typically deformed. The condition can affect any part of the skeleton. It may  affect only one or two parts of the skeleton, or it may be widespread. The  arms, spine, skull, pelvis, and leg bones are commonly affected. Doctors do not know what causes Paget’s disease of the bone.  Genetic and viral factors may play a role, but more research is required. While  there are no known preventive measures you can take, a diet that contains  adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, along with regular exercise, can  help promote bone health. "

Modern flu outbreaks that have occurred due to flu viruses that contain genes from swine and other types of flu viruses have been referred to as swine flu.

It often occurs in people who are elderly or  have a weakened immune system. It is thought that the inflammation resulting from sepsis  causes tiny blood clots to form, which can block oxygen and nutrients from reaching  vital organs. As a result, the organs fail, causing a profound septic  shock. This may cause a drop in blood  pressure and may result in death. In  fact, septic shock is the most common cause of death in intensive care units in  the United States (Fitch, et  al., 2002). Doctors have identified three stages of sepsis: sepsis, when an infection reaches the  bloodstream and causes inflammation throughout the body severe sepsis, which occurs when infection  disrupts blood flow to the brain or kidneys, leading to organ failure. Blood  clots cause gangrene (tissue death) in the arms, legs, fingers, and toes.  septic shock, when blood pressure drops  significantly.

As the infection develops in the lung, high fever is apparent along with chills and a cough that produces thick sputum. Chest pain can occur if the outer layer (pleura) of the lungs is involved in the inflammatory process. The skin color may become bluish or purplish if there are insufficient levels of oxygen in the blood. Nonspecific symptoms that can accompany pneumonia include headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and weakness."

Eye pain is  common, but it’s rarely a symptom of a serious condition. Most often, the pain  resolves on its own, without the need of medicine or treatment.Eye pain that occurs on the surface may be a scratching,  burning, or itching sensation. Surface pain is usually caused by irritation  from a foreign object, infection, or trauma. Often, this type of eye pain is easily  treated with eye drops or rest.Eye pain that occurs deeper within the eye may feel aching,  gritty, stabbing, or throbbing. This kind of eye pain may require more in-depth  treatment, but it is rarely a sign of a larger, more serious condition.  However, eye pain accompanied by vision loss may be a  symptom of an emergency medical issue. Call your ophthalmologist immediately if  you begin to lose your vision while experiencing eye pain."

According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, basal cell carcinoma is the most frequently  diagnosed form of skin cancer in the United States (Johns Hopkins, 2012). Most common in people over age  40, it typically occurs as a result of prolonged exposure to sunlight. Individuals  with basal cell nevus syndrome have a high risk of developing basal cell  carcinoma."

The blockage, partial ortotal, prevents the passage of fluid or digested food. If intestinal obstruction happens, food, fluids, gastric acids,and gas build up behind the site of the blockage. If enough pressure builds up,the intestine can rupture. This causes a leak of harmful stomach contents intoyour abdominal cavity. There are many potential causes of intestinal obstruction. Inmany cases, this condition can’t be prevented. Early diagnosis and treatmentare crucial. An untreated intestinal obstruction can be fatal."

      "disease": "neck lump",
      "description": "A lump in the neck is also called a neck mass. Neck lumps ormasses can be large and visible, or they can be very small. Most neck lumps arebenign (noncancerous) and not harmful. But a neck lump can also be a sign of aserious condition, such as an infection or a cancerous growth.If you have a neck lump, your doctor should evaluate itpromptly. See your doctor right away if you have an unexplained neck mass. Where does the lump come from?A lump in the neck can be hard, soft, tender or non-tender.It can be located in the skin (such as a sebaceous cyst or acne) or it can comefrom tissues and organs within your neck. Where the lump originates plays animportant role in determining what it is. Because there are many muscles,tissues, and organs near the neck, there are many places neck lumps can comefrom, including:lymph nodesthe thyroid gland, which     is a small, butterfly-shaped organ below the Adam’s appleparathyroid glands, which     are four small glands located behind the thyroid glandrecurrent laryngeal     nerves, which enable movement of the vocal cordsneck musclesthe trachea, or windpipethe larynx, or voice boxcervical vertebraenerves of the sympathetic     and parasympathetic nervous systemthe brachial plexus, which     is a series of nerves that supply your upper limbs and trapezius musclesalivary glands various arteries and veinsCommon underlying causes of neck lumpsAn enlarged lymph node is the most common cause of a neck lump.Lymph nodes contain cells that help your body fight off infections and attackmalignant cells (cancer). When you’re sick, your lymph nodes can becomeenlarged to help fight the infection. Other common causes of enlarged lymphnodes include:ear infectionssinus infectionstonsillitisstrep throatdental infectionsbacterial infections of     the scalpThere are other illnesses that can cause a neck lump: Autoimmune diseases,     cancer, and other disorders of the thyroid gland, such as goiter due to     iodine deficiency, can cause enlargement of part or all of your thyroid     gland. Viruses, like mumps, can     make your salivary glands enlarged. Injury or torticollis can     cause a lump in your neck muscles.CancerMost neck lumps are benign, but cancer is a possible cause.For adults, the chance that a neck lump is cancerous increases after the age of50, according to the Cleveland Clinic.Lifestyle choices, such as smoking and drinking, can also have an impact.Prolonged use of tobacco and alcohol are the two greatest riskfactors for cancers of the mouth and throat. Another common riskfactor for cancers of the neck, throat, and mouth is a human papilloma virus (HPV)infection. This infection is generally transmitted sexually, and it’s very common.Signs of an HPV infection are now found in two-thirds of all throat cancers,according to the American CancerSociety.Cancers that show up as a lump in the neck could include:cancers of the head and     neck tissuesHodgkin’s lymphomanon-Hodgkin’s lymphomaleukemiaother types of cancer,     including lung, skin, throat, and breast cancerVirusesWhen we think of viruses, we commonly think of the commoncold and the flu. However, there are other viruses out there, and many of them cancause a lump in your neck. These include:HIV or AIDSherpesinfectious mononucleosisrubellaviral pharyngitisBacteriaA bacterial infection can cause neck and throat problems,leading to inflammation and a neck lump. Many of these may treated with prescriptionantibiotics. These include:atypical mycobacterium,     which is a type of bacteria most common in people with compromised immune     systems and lung diseasecat scratch diseaseperitonsillar abscess,     which is an abscess on or near the tonsilsstrep throattonsillitistuberculosisOther possible causesThere are other, less common causes of neck lumps. Allergicreactions to medicine and food can cause neck lumps. A stone in the salivaryduct, which can block saliva, can also cause a neck lump.Other symptoms associated with a neck lumpBecause a neck lump can be caused by such a variety ofconditions and diseases, there can be many other possible related symptoms. Somepeople will have no symptoms. Others will have some symptoms that are relatedto the condition that’s causing the neck lump. If your neck lump is caused by an infection and your lymphnodes are enlarged, you might also have a sore throat, difficulty swallowingfood, or pain in the ear. If your neck lump is blocking your airway, you mightalso have trouble breathing or sound hoarse when you speak.Sometimes people with neck lumps that are caused by cancerhave skin changes around the area. They may also have blood or phlegm in theirsaliva.What to expect when you visit your doctorYour doctor will likely want to ask you about your health history,including details on your lifestyle habits and your symptoms. Your doctor willwant to know how long you’ve been smoking or drinking and how much you drinkand smoke on a daily basis. Your doctor will also want to know when yoursymptoms started and how severe they are. This will be followed by a physicalexam.During the physical exam, your doctor will carefully examineyour scalp, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, throat, and neck. Your doctor will lookfor any abnormal skin changes and other related symptoms.How is a neck lump diagnosed?Your diagnosis will be based on your symptoms, history, andthe results of the physical exam. In some cases, your doctor may refer you toan ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist for a detailed evaluation of yourears, nose, throat, and sinuses. The ENT specialist may perform an oto-rhino-laryngoscopy. In thisprocedure, your doctor will use a lighted instrument to see areas of your ears,nose, and throat that aren’t otherwise visible. This evaluation doesn’t requiregeneral anesthesia. In other words, you’ll be awake during the procedure.Your doctor and any specialist may run a variety of tests todetermine the cause of your neck lump. A CBC (complete blood count) can be doneto evaluate your overall general health and provide insight into a number ofpossible conditions. For instance, your white blood cell count may be high if youhave an infection.Other possible tests include:sinus X-rayschest X-ray, which allows     your doctor to see if there’s a problem in your lungs, trachea, or chest     lymph nodesultrasound of the neck,     which is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to evaluate neck lumpsMRI of the head and neck,     which makes detailed images of the structures in your head and neckHow to treat a neck lumpThe type of treatment for a neck lump depends on theunderlying cause. Lumps caused by bacterial infections are treated withantibiotics. Treatment options for cancer of the head and neck include surgery,radiation, and chemotherapy.Early detection is the key to successful treatment of theunderlying cause of a neck lump. According to the American Academy ofOtolaryngology, most cancers of the head and neck can be cured withfew side effects if they’re detected early. Outlook Neck lumps can happen to anyone, and they’re not always signsof something serious. However, it’s important to see your doctor to be sure.Like all illnesses, it’s better to get diagnosed and treated early, especiallyif your neck lump turns out to be caused by something more serious. If you havea neck lump and you’re concerned, call your doctor. "

In aortic regurgitation, some of  the blood leaks back into the left ventricle because the aortic valve does not  close tightly enough."

The NCI estimatesthat stomach cancer makes up only 1.5 percent of new cancer cases in the UnitedStates. While stomach cancer is relatively rare compared to other types ofcancer, one of the biggest dangers of stomach cancer is the difficulty ofdiagnosing it. Since stomach cancer usually doesn’t cause any early symptoms,it often goes undiagnosed until after it spreads to other parts of the body,making it more difficult to treat.

ON canflare up suddenly from an infection or nerve disease. The inflammation usually causestemporary vision loss that typically happens in only one eye. As you recoverand the inflammation goes away, your vision will likely return. Those with ON sometimes experience pain. There are otherconditions with symptoms that resemble the symptoms of ON. Doctors may useoptical coherence tomography (OCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to helpreach the correct diagnosis.ON doesn’t always require treatment and can heal on its own.Medications, such as corticosteroids, can help speed recovery. Most cases of ONhave complete (or nearly complete) vision recovery within 2 to 3 months, but it may take up to 12months to achieve the visual recovery."

Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects your skin and isusually not serious. Visceral leishmaniasis damages your internal organs andcan be life-threatening. Visceral leishmaniasis is also known as kala azar. Mucocutaneousleishmaniasis can lead to partial or complete destruction of the mucousmembranes found in your nose, throat, and mouth.The sand flies that carry the parasite typically reside intropical and subtropical environments. Fatal epidemics have occurred in areasof Africa, such as Sudan, Kenya, and Ethiopia.Unfortunately, affected regions are often remote and unstable,with limited resources for treating this disease.

This is because the brain does not receive  images from the lazy eye in the way that it does from the healthy eye. This  results in vision impairment and loss of depth perception.The affected eye doesn’t necessarily look different, though  it may “wander” in different directions. That’s where the term “lazy” comes  from. The condition will usually only affect one eye, but in certain  circumstances, the vision in both eyes can be affected. The condition usually occurs in children. According to the Optometrists Network, three percent of children under age  six will have some form of lazy eye (Cooper, 2012). It  is important to note that lazy eye is not a crossed or turned eye. That  condition is called strabismus. However, strabismus can lead to lazy eye if the  crossed eye gets much less use than the uncrossed one. Lazy eye is responsible for more loss of vision in people  under 40 than all other injuries and diseases combined (Optometrists Network). If a lazy eye goes  untreated, temporary or permanent loss of vision—including loss of depth  perception and 3D vision—can occur.The medical term for lazy eye is “amblyopia.” "

But it can have a profoundeffect on a person’s quality of life. People with anosmia may not be able fullytaste foods. They may lose interest in eating. This can lead to weight loss ormalnutrition. People with anosmia may also become depressed because they are notable to smell or taste pleasurable foods."

This fluid, which surrounds the unborn  baby in the womb, acts as a cushion, protecting the baby from injury. It also  keeps his or her temperature stable, and is needed to develop healthy bones and  lungs. In the womb, the baby is constantly inhaling and exhaling the fluid—this  is normal and healthy.   During labor, the baby’s body releases chemicals to  help the lungs push out the fluid. The pressure of the birth canal on a baby’s  chest also releases fluid. After birth, the baby’s cough, as well as air  filling his or her lungs, should expel the remaining amniotic fluid.   However, sometimes the fluid does not leave the  lungs as quickly and completely as it should. This excess fluid in the lungs  can make it difficult for the baby’s lungs to function properly. This condition  is known as transitory tachypnea of the newborn.  This condition typically causes a fast breathing  rate (tachypnea) for the infant. While the symptoms may be distressing, they  are typically not life-threatening. In fact, symptoms are transitory  (short-lived), usually disappearing within one to three days after birth.

One type of benign (non-cancerous) tumor is called a fibroadenoma.While not life-threatening, a fibroadenoma may still require treatment. A fibroadenoma is a non-cancerous tumor in the breast thatis commonly found in women under the age of 30. According to Mammotome, fibroadenomasare diagnosed in approximately 10 percent of women in the United States (Mammotome).African-American women are more likely to develop these tumors.The tumor consists of breast tissue and connective (stromal) tissue. According to Dr. David Zieve for PubMed, while most women only have onetumor, 10 to 15 percent of women have multiple lumps (PubMed).Fibroadenomas can occur in one or both breasts. FeelSome fibroadenomas are so small that they cannot be felt.When you are able to feel one, it is very distinct from the surrounding tissue.The edges are clearly defined and the tumors have a detectable shape. They aremoveable under the skin and are typically not tender. These tumors often feellike marbles, but may have a rubbery feel to them.CausesThe exact cause of fibroadenomas is not known. Hormones suchas estrogen may play a part in the growth and development of the tumors. Takingoral contraceptives before the age of 20 has been associated with a higher riskof developing fibroadenomas.These tumors may grow, particularly during pregnancy. Duringmenopause, they often shrink. It is also possible for fibroadenomas to resolveon their own. TypesThere are two types of fibroadenomas: simple fibroadenomasand complex fibroadenomas. The simple tumors do not increase breast cancer riskand look the same all over when viewed under a microscope. The complex tumorscontain other components such as macrocysts(fluid-filled sacs large enough to feel and to see without a microscope) and calcifications (calcium deposits).Complex fibroadenomas can slightly increase your risk ofbreast cancer. The American Cancer Society states that women with complexfibroadenomas have approximately one and a half to two times greater risk ofdeveloping breast cancer than women with no breast lumps (ACS)."

Usually, this term refers  to pus inside your pleural cavity, or “pleural space.” The pleural cavity is  the thin space between the surface of your lungs and the inner lining of your  chest wall. A cavity is a hollow space. Your  lungs sit inside your chest cavity, just as your brain rests inside your skull  cavity. Any fluid inside the chest cavity decreases the amount of space that  your lungs have to expand. In order to fill with air when you breathe in, your  lungs must be able to fully expand. When you breathe, your lungs should expand  smoothly and painlessly within the pleural cavity inside your chest. When your  lungs can’t expand properly, you have trouble getting the oxygen you need. This  causes you to become short of breath and it may even hurt for you to breathe. Because empyema is pus, and pus  is caused by an infection, empyema can lead to life-threatening problems such  as sepsis (bacteria in the blood) and shock. According to the American College  of Chest Physicians, empyema is a potentially life-threatening medical  emergency."

Since then, other strains of bird flu have been identified that also have the ability to cause severe disease and death. Human infections with a new avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013."

This leads to excessive bleeding. Thereare 13 types of clotting factors, and these work with platelets to help theblood clot. Platelets are small blood cells that form in your bone marrow. Accordingto the World Federation ofHemophilia (WFH), about one in 10,000 people are born with this disease.People with hemophilia bleed easily, and the blood takes a longertime to clot. People with hemophilia can experience spontaneous or internalbleeding and often have painful, swollen joints due to bleeding into thejoints. This rare but serious condition can have life-threateningcomplications.The three forms of hemophilia are hemophilia A, B, and C.Hemophilia A isthe most common type of hemophilia, and it’s caused by a deficiency in factorVIII. According to the NationalHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), eight out of 10 people withhemophilia have hemophilia A.Hemophilia B,which is also called Christmas disease, is caused by a deficiency of factor IX.Hemophilia C isa mild form of the disease that’s caused by a deficiency of factor XI. Peoplewith this rare type of hemophilia often don’t experience spontaneous bleeding.Hemorrhaging typically occurs after trauma or surgery.Hemophilia is an inherited genetic condition. This condition isn’tcurable, but it can be treated to minimize symptoms and prevent future healthcomplications.In extremely rare cases, hemophilia can develop after birth. Thisis called “acquired hemophilia.” This is the case in people whose immune systemforms antibodies that attack factors VIII or IX."

Contraction of  the prostate during ejaculation prevents semen from flowing backward into the  bladder. Acute prostatitis is usually  caused by the same bacteria that result in urinary tract infections and  sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  Bacteria can travel to the prostate from the blood, or enter the  prostate during or after a procedure such as a biopsy. It can also be caused by  infections in other parts of the male genitourinary tract."

It is a chronic, systemic disorder that affects one to four  million people in the United States, according to the National Institute of  Neurological Disorders. (NINDS)The condition is typically diagnosed as either primary or  secondary. In primary Sjögren’s syndrome, there is no other autoimmune disease  present. Secondary Sjögren’s syndrome is diagnosed when an individual has  another autoimmune disease.

The ACL stabilizes your knee, and tearing it either  partially or completely can cause pain and swelling. ACL injuries are commonly seen in  basketball, football, and soccer players, who often jump or pivot in reaction  to other athletes. Ignoring a torn ACL can potentially lead to further knee  injury.

In fact, one in every  ten cases of Parkinson’s at a Parkinson’s disease treatment center turned out  to be DIP (PublicCitizen). Drug-induced tremors can occur  when you move your body a certain way or are in certain positions. The tremors  are caused by certain medications, especially certain antipsychotics,  anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Medication can not only cause tremors but  worsen any preexisting tremors you may have as the result of Parkinson’s  disease or another similar disorder."

Lupus nephritis is one of the most serious complications of lupus.  It occurs when SLE causes your immune system to attack your kidneys—specifically,  the parts of the kidney that filter the blood for waste products. The kidneys play a vital part in your body’s functioning.  They remove waste from your blood. If they are damaged, you can become very  ill. People with damaged kidneys might have to get regular dialysis. This is a procedure in which  blood is cleaned by a filtration machine. These people may even need a kidney transplant. Research suggests that about half of those with SLE suffer  from lupus nephritis (Dooley, 2007). "

Yawning  is the involuntary process of opening the mouth and inhaling deeply, filling  the lungs with air. Some yawns are short, and some last for several seconds  before an open-mouthed exhale. Watery eyes, tears, runny rose, stretching, or  audible sighs may accompany yawning. The  reason humans yawn is unknown, but common triggers include fatigue and boredom.  Yawns sometimes occur when you see or hear someone else yawn or simply talk  about yawning. Scientists now believe contagious yawning may have something to  do with social communication (Brynie,  2011). In addition, new research suggests that yawning helps cool the  temperature of the brain.Excessive  yawning means that you yawn often, even when you are not tired. If frequent  yawning is negatively affecting your personal or professional life, it may be  considered excessive. "

Your spleen is extremely  important in your body’s fight against infection because it is the source of  your white blood cells. White blood cells protect your body from bacteria and  infections.

People with TN may initially have short, mild  instances of pain, but over time experience longer, more frequent attacks of  intense pain. Most people with TN experience symptoms in cycles. Pain comes and  goes for days or weeks, then subsides. In some cases, the condition becomes  progressive and the pain is always present.There is no specific test for TN, so diagnosis can take  time. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of the condition. Several  medications are available to provide relief from pain and to decrease the number  of episodes. Surgery is sometimes required."

It  is the primary stage of infection and lasts until the body has created antibodies  against HIV. During this stage of infection, the virus is duplicating at a  rapid rate. Unlike other viruses, the body's immune system is unable to fight off HIV, and the infection can live in cells for long periods of time. Over time, the virus attacks and destroys immune cells, leaving the immune system unable to fight off other diseases and infections. When this happens, HIV infection can lead to the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.Acute HIV is highly contagious. However, most people with  acute HIV do not yet know that they are infected. This is possibly due to the fact that most of the population is not  tested for HIV on a regular basis, or because standard HIV antibody tests may not be  able to detect this stage of infection. "

Moorman, director  of sports medicine at Duke University Medical Center, shin splints are more of  a cumulative stress disorder than an injury. The repeated pounding and stress  on the bones, muscles, and joints of the lower legs prevent your body from  being able to naturally repair and restore itself (Scientific  American, 2004). "

Closed-angle glaucoma is much less common. If they are not treated, all types  of glaucoma have the potential to cause damage to your optic nerve, which is  the nerve that transmits visual information to your brain. If you have closed-angle  glaucoma, pressure builds because fluid is not flowing out of your eye as it  should. Fluid is produced in the rear chamber of your eye, behind the colored  part, or iris. Normally, this fluid flows through your pupil, which is the  black center of your eye, into the front chamber of the eyeball. From there, it  goes through a series of channels called the trabecular meshwork and into the  veins of the sclera (the white of your eye).In closed-angle glaucoma, the trabecular network is  obstructed or damaged and flow through this drainage pathway is reduced or  blocked. The fluid backup then increases pressure within your eyeball. "

The major function of PTH is to regulate the level of calcium in the  body. It also controls the level of phosphorus and participates in the  production of the active form of vitamin D. All of these activities are  required to maintain calcium balance.   Having too little PTH causes low levels of  calcium and high levels of phosphorus in the body.

      "description": "The human brain works by sending electrical signals through neurons, which are nerve cells. Aseizure occurs when there’s a surge in this electrical activity. This causes ahost of physical symptoms, such as muscle contractions, visual disturbances,and blackouts. Seizures can affect the entire brain. A partial seizure is whena seizure occurs in just one area.A partial seizure may occur for many reasons, including epilepsy,brain tumors or infections, heat stroke, or low blood sugar. A seizure can’t betreated and must run its course. Diagnosing and treating the underlying causecan help reduce the number of partial seizures. Most people who experienceseizures are able to live normal lives with appropriate treatment."

The glands are also called “nodes”and can be found throughout the body. They are most apparent under the jaw, inthe armpits, and in the groin.Organs that make up the lymphatic system include:bone marrowspleenthymus, which is a small organ in your upperchest that helps white blood cells developImmune cells called lymphocytes mature within the bonemarrow and then travel to the lymph nodes and other organs within the lymphaticsystem to help protect the body against viruses and bacteria. The lymphaticsystem also filters a whitish-clear fluid called lymph, which containsbacteria-killing white blood cells. Lymph travels through the body along lymphatic vessels andcollects fats, bacteria, and other waste products from cells and tissues. Thelymph nodes then filter these harmful materials out of the fluid and producemore white blood cells to fight off the infection.Lymphangitis occurs when viruses and bacteria invade the vesselsof the lymphatic system, typically through an infected cut or wound. There areoften tender red streaks going from the wound toward the nearest lymph glands.Other symptoms include fever, chills, and a general sense of illness.If it’s treated quickly, lymphangitis often goes away withno ill effects. If left untreated, complications can occur, and the conditioncan become very serious.Lymphangitis is sometimes mistakenly called “bloodpoisoning.” It’s also sometimes mistaken for thrombophlebitis, which is a clotin a vein."

The severity of the symptoms varies widely among affected individuals. Other possible symptoms include learning to speak relatively late, not playing interactively with other children, avoidance of eye contact, lack of empathy, and social withdrawal. Children with ASD who have not developed sufficient language skills may act out, including screaming or crying, to express their needs. It is important to note that people with ASD may vary widely in their level of functioning, and not all people with ASD will experience all of the symptoms listed."

Your mouth andthroat normally contain many species of bacteria that are aspirated along withthe oral or gastric contents. These bacteria can grow in the lungs, whichbecomes pneumonia. The types of bacteria that most often cause this kind ofpneumonia are known as anaerobic bacteria. This includes peptostreptococcus,bacteroides and Prevotella bacteria families. E.coli can also be the culprit. It is important to remember that the oral orgastric contents can damage the lung tissue as well and cause inflammationknown as chemical pneumonitis.More commonly found kindsof bacterial pneumonia, known as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), areusually caused by streptococcus and pneumococcus bacterias.Aspiration pneumoniaaccounts for as much as 15 percent of pneumonia cases acquired outside of hospitals.

While often harmless, this can create a choking hazard  and put them in danger of serious injuries or infections. A foreign  body in the nose means that an object is present in the nose when it is not naturally  supposed to be there.Children under the age of 5 often have this issue,  although it is not uncommon for older children to also place foreign objects in  their nostrils.

Although chest pain and pressure are the characteristic symptoms, women are somewhat more likely than men to experience heart attack that does not occur in this typical fashion. Instead, some women with heart attacks may experience more of the other symptoms, like lightheadedness, nausea, extreme fatigue, fainting, dizziness, or pressure in the upper back. Because of the absence of typical symptoms associated with heart attacks in men, many women who have heart attacks think the symptoms are due to another condition, like the flu or gastroesophageal reflux."

An infection develops when the fungus overwhelms  your body’s ability to control it.   Oral thrush occurs most often in infants and toddlers. White lesions (bumps) on the inner cheeks and tongue are characteristic of  this condition.  Antifungal medications can effectively treat oral thrush,  and the condition usually does not cause complications for healthy patients.  However, oral thrush can be problematic for those with weakened immune systems.  "

      "description": "Pernicious anemia (PA) is an autoimmune disorder in which  the body fails to make enough healthy red blood cells (RBCs). The body requires  vitamin B-12 and a type of protein called intrinsic factor (IF) to make red  blood cells. Vitamin B-12, or cobalamin, is found in certain foods and  medications. IF is a protein made by the stomach’s mucosal (mucus-secreting)  cells, called parietal cells. When vitamin B-12 enters the body, it binds with  IF. The two are then absorbed in the last part of the small intestine. In the majority of cases of PA, the body’s immune system  attacks and destroys the stomach’s mucosal cells. IF can no longer be made, and  vitamin B-12 cannot be absorbed. Vitamin B-12 deficiency produces a small number of overly  large and ineffective RBCs called macrocytes. Because of their large size,  these cells may not be able to leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream.  The resulting decrease in oxygen-carrying RBCs in the bloodstream can lead to  fatigue and weakness. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  (NHLBI), this type of anemia is called “pernicious” because it was once  considered a deadly disease. This was due to the lack of available treatment.  Today, the disease is relatively easy to treat with B-12 shots or supplements.  (NHLBI,  2001) However, untreated vitamin B-12 deficiency can lead to more  severe complications such as neurological problems, chronic anemia, and stomach  cancer. "

These drugs include antibiotics and over-the-counter nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin,ibuprofen, and naproxen (Polsdorfer, 2012).AIHA developed from an overdose of lecithin in one extremelyunusual case. In this case, the patient took a large number of lecithinsupplements—over 5 capsules per day. Lecithinis a nutritional supplement that is typically harmless when taken inrecommended doses (CasesJournal, 2009). It is used extensively in commercially prepared food itemsas a substitution for dairy protein. Autoimmune diseasesattack the body itself. The body develops auto-antibodies that destroy redblood cells in the case of AIHA. The idiopathic form of the disorder isextremely serious. It is often life threatening because of its sudden onset.Idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia (IAIHA) requires immediate medicalattention and hospitalization. "

Obstructive sleep apnea is the interruption of breathing due to  blocked airways. People who have central sleep apnea do not have blockages in  their airways. The problem is in the connection between the brain and the  muscles that let you breathe.Central sleep apnea is much less common than obstructive  sleep apnea. The American Sleep Apnea Association (ASAA) estimates that less  than 20 percent of people with sleep apnea suffer from central sleep apnea. (ASAA)"

It’s characterized by a high fever, chills, fatigue,body aches, sore throat, and a dry cough. These symptoms can be similar to thecommon cold, but the flu is caused by a different family of viruses andsymptoms are typically much more severe.An infection withthe flu virus generally runs its course in one to two weeks. However, the flusometimes leads to secondary infections or other complications, generally incertain high-risk groups. These groups include those who are very young or over65, those who are pregnant, and those who have weakened immune systems. These secondaryeffects can cause serious illnesses, such as pneumonia, or even death.According to the AmericanLung Association (ALA), each year 226,000 people are hospitalized due toinfluenza and its complications. Flu-related deaths range from 3,000 to 49,000per year.The flu virus canspread quickly through communities and areas where people work or live closetogether, leading to epidemics. Schools, nursing homes, and workplaces are atparticular risk of outbreaks. Now and then, anespecially virulent form of influenza will infect people around the world inwhat is called a pandemic. The H1N1 virus in the 2009 to 2010 flu season was apandemic. Flu epidemics and pandemics are most effectively prevented bywidespread vaccination via an annual flu shot.The Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) recommend that all those six months of age andolder—especially those at high risk for complications—receive an annual fluvaccine."

Thebile ducts carry bile from the liver and gallbladder through the pancreas tothe duodenum, which is a part of the small intestine. Bile is a dark-green oryellowish-brown fluid secreted by the liver to digest fats. Much of the bile isreleased directly into the small intestine, and what remains is stored in thegallbladder. After you eat, the gallbladder releases bile to help indigestion and fat absorption. Bile also helps rid the liver of waste products. Obstructionof any of these bile ducts is referred to as a biliary obstruction. Many of the conditions related to biliary obstructions canbe treated successfully. However, if the blockage remains untreated for a long time,it can lead to life-threatening diseases of the liver.You have several types of bileducts. The two types of bile ducts in the liver are intrahepatic andextrahepatic ducts.Intrahepatic ducts are a system of smaller tubes within theliver that collect and transport bile to the extrahepatic ducts. Theextrahepatic ducts begin as two parts, one on the right of the liver and theother on the left. As they descend from the liver, they unite to form thecommon hepatic duct. This runs directly toward the small intestine.The biliary duct, or the duct from the gallbladder, alsoopens into the common hepatic duct. The bile duct from this point onward isknown as the common bile duct or choledochus. Before emptying into the smallintestine, the common bile duct passes through the pancreas."

Also known as the stomach flu, viral gastroenteritis  can affect anyone throughout the world. This highly contagious illness spreads  through close contact with people who are infected, or through contaminated  food or water. It can easily spread in close quarters, such as childcare  facilities, schools, nursing homes, and cruise ships. Many different  viruses can cause the illness, each with its own peak season. The most common  viruses include:RotavirusThis virus commonly affects infants and young children, who  then spread the infection to other children and adults. It is usually spread  orally, meaning the virus enters a person’s body through their mouth. Symptoms  typically appear within two days of infection and include vomiting, loss of  appetite, and watery diarrhea. According to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC), this virus is most common between the months of December and  June. (CDC, 2011) NorovirusThis type of virus is highly contagious and can affect  anyone at any age. It is spread through contaminated food, water, and surfaces,  or by infected people. This type of virus is common in crowded spaces, such as  nursing homes, daycares, and schools. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, fever,  and body aches. Most norovirus outbreaks in the United States occur between  November and April. According to the  National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), viral gastroenteritis is  the leading cause of severe diarrhea in adults and children. (NCBI, 2012) Children under the age of five and the elderly are at particular risk  of severe diarrhea. There are steps you  can take to lower your chances of contracting the viruses that cause viral gastroenteritis.  These include frequent hand washing and avoiding contaminated water and food  products. A rotavirus vaccine was approved for infants in 2006; early  vaccination is recommended to prevent severe rotavirus illnesses in infants and  small children.Most people make a  full recovery in two or three days, with no lasting side effects."

It sends the signals to theoptic nerve, which carries them to the brain.It develops slowly and eventually interferes with your vision.You might end up with cataracts in both eyes, but they usually don’t form atthe same time. Cataracts are common in older people. Over half of people in theUnited States have cataracts or have undergone cataract surgery by the timethey’re 80 years old, according to the National Eye Institute."

It is unusual (but not impossible) for endometrial  tissue to spread beyond the pelvic region.   The misplaced endometrial tissue follows the menstrual cycle under the  influence of hormonal changes. This means the tissue will grow, thicken, and  break down. Over time it will have nowhere to exit and become trapped. This causes irritation, scar formation, or adhesions (binding of organs  by abnormal tissue) with the surrounding tissues. It may lead to severe pain  during your periods and possible fertility problems "

Within the blood stream,  the bacteria grow and replicate.  Different arthropods carry specific rickettsaie bacteria for each type of typhus. Typhus symptoms vary slightly  by type. The most common symptoms are universal, affecting nearly all typhus  patients.   Treatment focuses on using antibiotic medication to stop the  infection. Untreated typhus can lead to serious complications and be  potentially fatal. Prevention of typhus is easier than treatment. Methods of  prevention focus on destroying or avoiding arthropod infestations. "

However, if you are experiencing testicle pain and have not been injured, you  need to have your symptoms evaluated.   Pain in the scrotum can be the result of serious  conditions like testicular torsion or a sexually transmitted infection (STI).  Ignoring the pain may cause irreversible damage to the testicles and scrotum.   Often problems with the testicles cause abdominal  or groin pain before testicle pain develops. Unexplained abdominal or groin  pain should also be evaluated by a doctor. "

Thisdisturbance sends out electrical signals to your muscles, nerves, or glands.These signals can make you lose consciousness and have severe musclecontractions.Seizures can happen when you have a condition called epilepsy.According to the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention, about 5.1 million people in the UnitedStates have a history of epilepsy. However, a seizure could also occur becauseyou have a high fever, a head injury, or low blood sugar. Sometimes, peoplehave a seizure as a part of the process of withdrawing from drug or alcoholaddiction.Tonic-clonic seizures get their name from their two distinctstages. In the tonic stage of the seizure, your muscles stiffen, you loseconsciousness, and you may fall down. The clonic stage consists of rapid musclecontractions, sometimes called convulsions. Tonic-clonic seizures usually last1-3 minutes. If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, it’s a medicalemergency.If you have epilepsy, you might begin to have generalizedtonic-clonic seizures in late childhood or adolescence. This type of seizure israrely seen in children under 2.A one-time seizure that’s not related to epilepsy could happen atany stage of your life. These seizures are normally brought about by atriggering event that temporarily alters your brain functioning.A generalized tonic-clonic seizure may be a medical emergency.Whether the seizure is a medical emergency or not depends on your history ofepilepsy or other conditions. Seek immediate medical help if this is your firstseizure or if you’ve been injured during the seizure."

      "description": "Toxic shock syndrome is a rare but serious medical condition  caused by a bacterial infection. This condition is the result of toxins  produced by the Staphylococcus aureus bacterium. Although toxic shock syndrome has been linked to tampon use in  menstruating women, this condition can affect men, children, and people of all  ages. According to the National Institutes of Health, tampon use is a factor in  less than half of toxic shock cases. (NIH, 2010) Infection usually occurs when bacteria enters your body through  an opening in your skin. For instance, bacteria can enter through a cut, sore,  or other wound. Experts are not sure why tampon use sometimes leads to the  condition, according to the Mayo Clinic. Some believe that a tampon left in  place for a long period of time attracts bacteria. Another possibility is that  tampon fibers scratch the vagina, creating an opening for bacteria to enter  your bloodstream. (Mayo  Clinic, 2011) Risk factors for this condition include a recent skin burn, skin  infection, or surgery. Other risk factors may include:recent childbirth use of a diaphragm or vaginal sponge to prevent  pregnancy an open skin woundToxic Shock-Like Syndrome A different but similar condition can result from toxins produced  by the group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacterium.  This is sometimes referred to as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome or toxic  shock-like syndrome (TSLS). It occurs when bacteria of this type are present in  parts of your body where bacteria are not usually found. For instance, it would  be abnormal to find this type of bacteria in your blood, muscles, or lungs. The symptoms and treatment for this syndrome are nearly identical  to those of toxic shock syndrome. However, TSLS is not associated with tampon  use.People who are at greater risk for a GAS infection are also more  likely to develop TSLS. Your risk may be increased if you:have diabetesare an alcoholichave chickenpox (varicella)have undergone surgery"

If the brain, the nervous system, the muscles, or theconnections between are injured or affected by disease, the muscle won’tcontract normally and muscle weakness is the resultant symptom.This is different from theweakness you may feel as a result of a tough workout, for instance. Thedifference is that a workout will exhaust muscles and there is recovery withrest, but true muscular weakness is a sign of something deeper."

There are two types of NF, both of which cause tumor growth and affect multiple  systems in the body. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is more common than  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). According to the University of Medicine and  Dentistry of New Jersey, NF1 occurs in approximately one in 3,000 people,  whereas NF2 is found in one in 40,000 people (NMDNJ).Although most tumors caused by NF are not cancerous, they  can still be dangerous and impair your quality of life. NF2 and TumorsNF2 causes noncancerous tumors to grow on your cranial and  spinal nerves. Unlike NF1, NF2 does not typically present any visible symptoms  and is rare in children. The tumors caused by NF2 are usually on the eighth  cranial nerve. This nerve connects your inner ear to your brain. These tumors  are called acoustic neuromas and can cause balance difficulties and hearing  loss. Schwannomas are another kind of tumor that occurs in  patients with NF2. These originate from schwann cells, which protect your nerve  cells. Spinal cord schwannomas are common in individuals with NF2, and if left  untreated, they can cause paralysis. NF2 and GeneticsBecause NF2 is a genetic condition, individuals can inherit  the disease, although this is not always the case. According to the National Institute  of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, between 30 and 50 percent of cases are  caused by a random genetic mutation. Once the mutation occurs, the condition  can be passed down from generation to generation (NINDS)."

This worry may prompt us to return home to make sure that everything is all right.  While this type of worry and behavior is normal, some people experience extreme  anxiety about these issues. Often the anxiety is so intense that it impacts a  person’s ability to live a normal life. To reduce the anxiety, the person may  engage in repetitive actions and may experience an increase in anxiety if these  actions are not performed. When this occurs, the person may be diagnosed with  obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD.  Obsessive-compulsive disorder is an anxiety  disorder. People who develop this disorder have uncontrollable thoughts and  fears (obsessions). These obsessions cause repetitive behaviors (compulsions)  that the person uses in an effort to stop the obsessions. People with this  disorder may realize that their obsessions are unreasonable, and they may try  to stop their compulsive behavior. Stopping the compulsive behavior increases  anxiety and distress, driving the person to resume performing the behavior."

It is divided into two subtypes based  on the type of mood disorder that is involved:depressive       subtype: involves major depressive episodes onlybipolar       subtype: involves manic episodes (high energy with extreme elevated,       expansive, or irritable mood) with or without depressive episodesSymptoms of psychosis and mood disorders may  occur together or separately. Oftentimes, individuals with schizoaffective  disorder experience symptoms in cycles alternating with periods of improvement.  Schizoaffective disorder is less common than schizophrenia and mood disorders. Unfortunately,  not many studies have been done on the disorder. Estimates published in the Archives of General Psychology suggest  that it is fairly rare, affecting less than 1 percent of the population. It is  also thought to affect women more often than men (Perälä, et al, 2007)."

      "description": "The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the throat tothe stomach. Achalasia is a serious condition that affects your esophagus. The loweresophageal sphincter (LES) is a valve that closes off the esophagus from thestomach. If you have achalasia, your LES fails to open up during swallowing,which it’s supposed to do. This leads to a backup of food within your esophagus.This condition can be related to damaged nerves in your esophagus. It can alsobe due to damage of the LES. According to the Cleveland Clinic, achalasia affects about 3,000people in the United States every year."

A food additive called monosodium  glutamate (MSG) is often blamed for Chinese restaurant syndrome, but scientific  evidence has not proven MSG to be the cause of the symptoms. However, there is  not another scientifically proven explanation for the symptoms. Most people can  eat foods that contain MSG without any problems. A small percentage of people  have bad reactions to the food additive. Because of the controversy over MSG,  many restaurants, Chinese and otherwise, now advertise that they do not add MSG  to their foods."

However, research has alloweddoctors to develop a course of treatment that effectively controls rosacea byminimizing its symptoms.There are four subtypes of rosacea. Each subtype has its ownset of symptoms. It is possible to have more than one subtype of rosacea at atime. Rosacea’s trademark are small, red, pus-filled bumps on theskin that are present during flare-ups. Typically, rosacea affects only skin onyour nose, cheeks, and forehead. Flare-ups often occur in cycles. This means that you willexperience symptoms for weeks or months at a time, the symptoms will go away,and then they will return."

      "disease": "aortic coarctation",
      "description": "Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is  a congenital malformation of the aorta. The condition is also known as aortic coarctation. Either name  indicates a constriction of the aorta. The aorta is the largest artery  in your body. With a diameter about the size of a garden hose, the aorta leaves  the left ventricle of the heart and runs through the middle of your body,  through the chest and into the abdominal area. There, it branches out to  deliver freshly oxygenated blood to your lower limbs. A constriction or narrowing  of this important artery can result in decreased flow of oxygen.  In CoA, the constricted part is  generally near the top of the aorta and acts like a kink in a hose. As your  heart tries to pump oxygen-rich blood to the body, the blood has trouble getting  through the kink. This causes high blood pressure in the upper parts of your  body and reduced blood flow to the lower parts of your body.  CoA is generally diagnosed and  treated shortly after birth through surgery. These children usually grow up to  lead normal, healthy lives. However, if your child is not diagnosed with CoA  until he or she is older, your child is at risk for high blood pressure and  heart problems. He or she may require close medical monitoring. Without treatment, CoA patients generally die in their 30s  to 40s of heart disease or from complications of chronic high blood pressure."

In addition to the typical symptoms of drunkenness, which begin early in the process, alcohol poisoning also affects breathing, regulation of body temperature, and can lead to seizures. Alcohol also inhibits the gag reflex, which means that people with alcohol overdose may choke on their own vomit. Hypothermia (low body temperature) and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) are complications of alcohol poisoning along with irregular heartbeat and slowed and irregular breathing."

This can lead to a varietyof issues, including fatigue, difficulty breathing, blood clots, and heartfailure.Scarring caused byrheumatic fever is the leading cause of mitral valve stenosis.

In more serious cases of gum disease, there is damage to the soft tissues and bones that support the teeth (periodontitis), leading to separation of the teeth from the gums.

Accordingto the NationalEye Institute, it affects 5 to 10 percent ofAmericans. To understand farsightedness, it’simportant to understand how the eye works. Two parts of the eye are responsiblefor focusing: the cornea and the lens. The cornea is the clearfront surface of the eye. The lens is a structure inside youreye that changes shape as you focus on objects. The cornea and lens work togetherto refract, or bend, incoming light. Then they focus that light onto yourretina. The retina is at the back of your eyeball. It receives visualinformation and sends it to your optic nerve. Your optic nerve carriesthat information to your brain. A perfectly formed, curved lens andcornea result in a perfectly focused image. If your cornea is too flat, youreye can’t focus correctly. There are varying degrees offarsightedness, depending on the eyes’ ability to focus on close-up objects. Ifyou can only clearly see objects that are very far away, you’re severelyfarsighted. Generally this is easy to correct. "

People  with these disorders do not make heme, a component of hemoglobin (protein in  red blood cells that carries oxygen) properly. Heme is made of porphyrin (a  naturally-occurring organic compound in the body) bound to iron. Heme helps red  blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen and also gives RBCs their color. It is also found  in myoglobin, a protein in the heart and skeletal muscles.  The body goes through several steps to make heme. However,  in people with porphyria, the body lacks certain enzymes needed to complete  this process, causing porphyrin to accumulate in tissues and blood. This may  cause a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. The most common symptoms  of porphyria are abdominal pain, light sensitivity (causing rashes or  blisters), and problems with the muscles and nervous system. The symptoms of  porphyria vary and depend on which enzyme is missing. "

It should be able to be extended so that it is completely  straight (Merck  & Co., Inc., 2009).A reduction in normal range of motion in any of the joints is known as limited range of motion. Joint range of  motion naturally declines as you age, but it can also occur along with a number  of conditions.

This injury can be related to a  single very loud noise or by exposure to a lower decibel noise over a long  period of time. Some injuries to the head can cause acoustic trauma if the  eardrum is ruptured, or if other injuries to the inner ear occur.  The eardrum protects the middle  and inner ear. It also transmits signals to the brain by way of small  vibrations. Acoustic trauma can damage the way that these vibrations are  handled, causing hearing loss. Sound moving into the inner ear can cause what  doctors sometimes call a “threshold shift,” which can trigger hearing loss."

It canappear on your sexual organs, rectum, or inside your mouth. This sore is calleda chancre. People oftenfail to notice it right away.Syphilis can be challenging to diagnose. You can be infectedwithout showing any symptoms for years. However, the earlier you discover theinfection, the better. Syphilis that remains untreated for a long time cancause major damage to important organs, like the heart and brain.Syphilis is only spread through direct contact withsyphilitic chancres.

Low levels of cortisol can cause weakness, fatigue, and low bloodpressure. You may have more symptoms if you have untreated Addison’s disease ordamaged adrenal glands due to severe stress, such as from a car accident or aninfection. These symptoms include sudden dizziness, vomiting, and even loss ofconsciousness. This is called an Addisonian crisis.

This infection is common in babies and can occur in people of any age. A white tongue is a common sign, and this can be associated with white patches in the throat or anywhere in the mouth, such as the palate or inner cheeks. Soreness and mouth pain can also be present. In severe cases, the infection can spread into the throat and esophagus and may lead to pain or problems with swallowing. Fever may be present if the infection spreads widely."

It is about the size of a pea. Despite its size, the pituitary gland is responsible for  producing hormones that regulate very critical body organs and glands. Some of  these include the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, the ovaries, and the  testicles. It is because of this control of other body systems that the  pituitary gland is known as the “master” gland.Most tumors of the  pituitary gland are noncancerous (benign). Most are also functioning. This  means they produce hormones. Those that do not produce hormones are called  nonfunctioning tumors.If you have a tumor  of the pituitary gland, it is unlikely to be cancerous. Cancerous pituitary tumors  are extremely rare. "

      "description": "Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes, is a very commoncondition in newborns. In fact, about 60 percent ofinfants get jaundice within several days of birth. It can occur when babieshave a high level of bilirubin in their blood. Bilirubin is a yellow pigmentproduced during the breakdown of red blood cells. Normally, bilirubin passes through the liver, which releases itinto the intestinal tract. In newborns, however, the liver is oftenunderdeveloped and may not be able to remove bilirubin from the blood. When there’stoo much bilirubin in the blood, it can settle in the skin. This causes theskin and eyes to appear yellow. Breast milk jaundice is a type of jaundice associated withbreast-feeding. It typically occurs one week after birth. The condition cansometimes last up to 12 weeks, but it rarely causes complications in healthy,breast-fed infants. The exact cause of breast milk jaundice isn’t known. However, itmay be linked to a substance in the breast milk that prevents certain proteinsin the infant’s liver from breaking down bilirubin. The condition may also runin families. Breast milk jaundice is rare, affecting lessthan 3 percent of infants. When it does occur, it usually doesn’t cause anyproblems and eventually goes away on its own. It’s safe to continuebreast-feeding your baby.It’s important to note that breast milk jaundice isn’t related tobreast-feeding jaundice. Breast-feeding jaundice only develops in newborns thatstruggle with breast-feeding and don’t get enough breast milk. Infants withbreast milk jaundice, on the other hand, can properly latch onto the breast andreceive adequate amounts of breast milk. Any signs of jaundice in your infant should be checked by yourdoctor. They can make sure that there isn’t a more serious cause or underlyingproblem. Severe, untreated jaundice in newborns can lead to complications,including permanent brain damage or hearing loss."

The liver commonly repairs itself by rebuilding new livercells when the old ones are damaged. When there’s repeated damage to the liver,permanent scarring takes place. This is called cirrhosis.Fatty liver is common. Around 10 to 20 percent of Americanshave too much fat in their liver, but no inflammation or damage is present.Most cases of fatty liver are detected in people between ages 40 and 60.

Thyroid nodules are common and rarely cancerous.  Your thyroid  is a small butterfly-shaped gland that is located near your larynx (voice box).  Your thyroid produces two hormones and secretes them into your bloodstream. The  two thyroid hormones affect your heart rate, body temperature, and many body  processes—a group of chemical reactions that, together, are called “metabolism.”  Thyroid  nodules are classified cold, warm, or hot, depending on whether they produce thyroid  hormones or not. Cold nodules don’t produce thyroid hormones. Warm nodules act  as normal thyroid cells. Hot nodules overproduce thyroid hormones.  Most thyroid  nodules are not serious and don’t cause any symptoms. It’s possible for you to  have a thyroid nodule without knowing it. Unless it becomes large enough to  press against your windpipe and hamper your breathing, you may have no  symptoms. Your doctor may be able to feel it during a physical exam.   According to  the American Thyroid Association, about 90 percent of all thyroid nodules are  benign—in other words, noncancerous (ATA, 2012). "

But the  condition can occur in both men and women at any age. If treatment for bladder neck  obstruction is delayed for a long period, your bladder may become permanently  weakened. Bladder diverticula (bulging pouches in the weakened bladder) may  form. Incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine) sometimes continues even  after treatment.

If the substance  remains in the body, it may build up. This can cause significant health  complications.  Metachromatic leukodystrophy  (MLD) occurs when an enzyme known as arylsulfatase A  (ARSA) is not present in the body. ARSA breaks down fats known as sulfatides. Without  ARA, sulfatides build up in cells, especially in the cells of the nervous  system, causing damage to various organs, including the kidneys and nervous system  (brain and spinal cord). These substances affect the nerves in the body,  damaging them so that they are unable to send electrical impulses. Muscle  weakness or lack of muscle control is common in patients with MLD and is a  result of this type of damage to the nerves.  MLD is a rare  disorder reported to occur in one in 40,000 to 160,000 worldwide, more in  certain genetically isolated populations. MLD is passed down in families  (inherited). Children must receive a gene from each parent to develop the  disorder. Children who have only one gene for MLD are called carriers. Carriers  are able to pass on the condition but do not have any symptoms of the disorder.  MLD  is also known asARSA deficiency arylsulfatase A deficiency disease cerebral sclerosis, diffuse, metachromatic form Greenfield’s diseasecerebroside sulphatase deficiency diseasemetachromatic leukoencephalopathysulfatide lipidosissulfatidosis"

The lymphatic  system helps the immune system get rid of waste and fight infections. There are  two main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Hodgkin’s disease (HD) is also called Hodgkin disease,  Hodgkin lymphoma, or Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The disease was named after its  discoverer, Dr. Thomas Hodgkin. The cancer originates in white blood cells  called lymphocytes. These cells help the body fight infection. HD can occur at any age but is most prevalent between the  ages of 15 and 40 and after the age of 55, according to the American Cancer  Society (ACS,  2012). HD originates most often in the lymph nodes of the chest, neck, and  underarms. There are two main types of HD: classic Hodgkin’s disease  and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin’s disease. Classic HD has several  subtypes and comprises approximately 95 percent of all diagnoses of HD in  developed countries (ACS,  2012). While the main cause of HD is unknown, there have been links to  environmental exposures as well as to the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes  mononucleosis. The overall survival rate for HD has increased due to  advances in treatment. According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year  and 10-year survival rates for the disease are approximately 85 percent and 81  percent, respectively (ACS,  2012). "

Type 1 HRS is associated with rapid kidney failure. There  is also an overproduction of creatinine. Type 2 HRS is associated with more  gradual kidney damage. It generally progresses more slowly. Symptoms are  generally subtler.   HRS  is an extremely serious condition. It is almost always fatal. According to an  article in Clinical Biochemist Reviews,  people with type 1 HRS have a median survival time of two weeks. Almost everyone  with this type of the disease will die within eight to 10 weeks. The median  survival time for type 2 is six months. (Ng, etal., 2007). "

When it does produce symptoms and signs, these may not appear for weeks after your infection. Symptoms in women include burning with urination and an abnormal vaginal discharge. Abdominal or pelvic pain is sometimes present. Blood in the urine, urinary urgency (feeling an urgent need to urinate), and increased urinary frequency can occur if the urethra is infected. In men, symptoms, when they occur, can include a discharge from the penis and a burning sensation when urinating. Pain in the testicles sometimes occurs. In both men and women, infection of the rectum can cause rectal pain, bleeding, and discharge from the rectum."

PTTD may also be called “acquired adult flat foot.”  This condition can usually be treated without surgery, but sometimes surgery is  required to repair the tendon. "

It occurs when a temporary blood vessel, called the ductusarteriosus, doesn’t close soon after birth. Symptoms may be minimal or severe.In rare cases, the defect can go undetected and can exist in adulthood.Correction of the defect is usually successful and restores the heart to itsnormal function.In a normally functioning heart, the pulmonary artery carriesblood to the lungs to collect oxygen. The oxygenated blood then travels throughthe aorta (the body’s main artery) to the rest of the body. In the womb, ablood vessel called the ductus arteriosus connects the aorta and pulmonaryartery. It allows blood to flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta and outto the body without going through the lungs. This is because the developingchild gets oxygenated blood from the mother, not from their own lungs.Soon after a baby is born, the ductus arteriosus should close upto prevent mixing oxygen-poor blood from the pulmonary artery with oxygen-richblood from the aorta. When this doesn’t happen, the baby has patent ductusarteriosus (PDA). If a doctor never detects the defect, the baby may grow intoan adult with PDA, although this is rare."

      "description": "A spinal cord injury is damage to the spinal cord. It’s anextremely serious type of physical trauma that’s likely to have a lasting andsignificant impact on most aspects of daily life.The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves and other tissue that thevertebrae of the spine contains and protects. The vertebrae are the bonesstacked on top of each other that make up the spine. The spine contains manynerves, and extends from the brain’s base down the back, ending close to thebuttocks.The spinal cord is responsible for sending messages from thebrain to all parts of the body. It also sends messages from the body to thebrain. We are able to perceive pain and move our limbs because of messages sentthrough the spinal cord.If the spinal cord sustains an injury, some or all of theseimpulses may not be able to “get through.” The result is a complete or totalloss of sensation and mobility below the injury. A spinal cord injury closer tothe neck will typically cause paralysis throughout a larger part of the bodythan one in the lower back area."

ITP,  also called immune thrombocytopenic purpura, stems from unusually low levels of  platelets, or “thrombocytes,” in the blood.Platelets are produced in the  bone marrow. They help stop bleeding by clumping together to form a clot that  seals cuts or small tears in blood vessel walls. Without enough platelets, the  blood is slow to clot. Internal bleeding or bleeding on or under the skin can  result.  People with ITP often have  many purple bruises, called purpura on the skin or mucous membranes inside the mouth. These bruises may also appear  as pinpoint-sized red or purple dots on the skin and are called petechiae (pronounced  “peh-TEE-kee-ay”). Petechiae may look like a rash.   According to the Mayo Clinic,  ITP occurs in children and adults. In children, it is found in roughly equal  numbers in boys and girls. In adults, ITP is most often seen after age 60 and  is two to three times more common in women than in men (Mayo  Clinic, 2010)."

It is  also known as cranial arteritis or giant cell arteritis. Although this  condition usually occurs in the temporal arteries, temporal arteritis can occur  in almost any medium to large artery in the body. Older individuals, over 60 years of age, are more likely  than younger individuals to develop the condition. According to St. Luke’s Cataract  and Laser Institute, women are almost four times as likely as men to develop  temporal arteritis. Although the exact cause of the condition is unknown, there  may be a link with the body’s autoimmune response. In addition, excessive doses  of antibiotics and certain severe infections have been linked to temporal  arteritis. There is no known prevention for the condition. However, once  diagnosed, temporal arteritis can be treated to minimize complications.If you think that you may have temporal arteritis, it is  imperative that you go see a doctor as soon as possible. Temporal arteritis can  cause very serious complications, but the risk of developing these  complications can be reduced by seeking immediate medical attention and  treatment."

Joints can become warm, swollen, reddened, painful, and tender. Joint pain and stiffness, particularly early in the morning, are often early symptoms. Usually, multiple joints on both sides of the body are affected. Depending on the specific joints that are affected, other possible symptoms include limping, hoarseness, and painful walking.

Because it’s an acute, or aggressive, form of cancer, it movesrapidly. Most types of ALL can be treated with a good chance of remission inchildren. However, adults with ALL don’t have as high of a remission rate aschildren.According to the AmericanCancer Society (ACS), about 6,050 new cases of ALL, 3,450 males and 2,600females, were diagnosed in the United States in 2012. Another 1,440 deaths, 820in males and 620 in females, from ALL were also reported. Although most casesappeared in children, four out five deaths occurred in adults. Children youngerthan age 5 were at a higher risk of developing ALL. However, children aretypically better than adults at tolerating aggressive treatment. "

They commonly believe that their way ofthinking and behaving is completely normal. However, they tend to have a viewof the world that is quite different than others. As a result, they may find itdifficult to participate in social, educational, and family activities. Theyalso place blame on others for their challenges. These behaviors and attitudesoften cause problems and limitations in relationships, social encounters, andwork or school settings. They may also make people with personality disordersfeel isolated, which can contribute to depression and anxiety.The cause of personality disorders isn’t known. However, it isbelieved that they may be triggered by genetic and environmental influences,most prominently childhood trauma. Personality disorders tend to emerge in the teenage years orearly adulthood. The symptoms vary depending on the specific type ofpersonality disorder.

The condition is also a symptom of several geneticdiseases, including Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.You may grow concerned if your child is not meeting height andweight growth standards. Growth hormone deficiency is treatable. Children whoare diagnosed early often recover very well. If left untreated, the conditioncan result in shorter-than-average height and delayed puberty. Your body still needs growth hormone after you’ve finishedpuberty. Once you’re in adulthood, the growth hormone maintains your bodystructure and metabolism.

When mucus comes out of your nose, it  is called nasal discharge, or more commonly, a runny nose.   Nasal discharge can  also be called post-nasal drip or  rhinorrhea.   Although it is  annoying, nasal discharge is common and usually goes away on its own. In some  cases though, nasal discharge is a sign of a more serious problem that requires  medical attention. "

Rickets leads to poor  functioning of a bone’s growth plate (growing edge), softened and weakened  bones, stunted growth, and, in severe cases, skeletal deformities. Vitamin  D helps your body  absorb calcium and phosphate from your intestines. You can get vitamin D from the  foods you eat, such as milk, eggs, and fish, but your body also makes the  vitamin when you’re exposed to sunlight. A vitamin D deficiency makes it difficult for your  body to maintain high enough levels of calcium and phosphate. When this occurs,  your body releases hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released  from your bones. When your bones lack these minerals, they become weak and  soft.Rickets is most common in children ages 6 to 24  months. Children are at the highest risk of rickets because they are still  growing. Children might not get enough vitamin D if they live in a climate with  little sunlight, have dark skin, do not drink milk products, or follow a  vegetarian diet. In some cases, the condition is hereditary. According to the National Institutes of Health  (NIH), rickets is rare in the United States. Rickets used to be more common,  but mostly disappeared in developed countries during the 1940s due to the  introduction of fortified foods, such as cereals with added vitamin D (NIH)."

The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects your mouth toyour stomach. The veins in your lower esophagus can become swollen when bloodflow to the liver is reduced. This may be due to scar tissue or a blood clot. When blood flow is obstructed, blood builds up in other bloodvessels nearby, including those in your lower esophagus. However, these veinsare much smaller and incapable of carrying large amounts of blood. They dilateand swell as a result of the increased blood flow. The swollen veins are known as esophageal varices. Esophageal varices may leak blood and eventually rupture. Thiscan lead to severe bleeding and life-threatening complications. When thishappens, it’s a medical emergency.

Accordingto the American Heart Association, a blood pressure reading of less than 120/80mmHg is considered normal. When you have high blood pressure, your blood movesthrough your arteries at a higher pressure, putting more pressure on thedelicate tissues and damaging your blood vessels. You are diagnosed with high bloodpressure (hypertension) if your blood pressure readings are consistently above140/90 mmHg."

There are several types of DI, and they can often be successfully treated. This condition is not related to diabetes mellitus (the disease most often referred to as simply “diabetes”). Normal Fluid RegulationTo understand diabetes insipidus, it helps to understand how your body normally uses and regulates fluids. Fluids make up as much as 60 percent of your overall body mass. Maintaining the proper amount of fluid in your body is key to your overall health. You must drink water to balance and regulate the fluid in your body. In addition to your active intake of water and fluids, your body uses a system of organs and hormone signals to regulate body fluids. The kidneys play an important role in this fluid regulation by removing extra fluid from your bloodstream. The bladder stores this fluid waste until you urinate it out. Your body regulates fluid levels by making less urine when you need to replace fluid lost to sweating, or by making more urine when there is too much fluid in your body. Your brain regulates this process in a few ways. The hypothalamus, a part of the brain, regulates your feeling of thirst and the need to drink water. The brain also produces an anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), called vasopressin, which is stored in the pituitary gland after production. When your body needs to retain water, the pituitary gland will release the vasopressin into the blood stream. When you need to get rid of water, the hormone is not release, and your kidneys will cause you to urinate more often.When any part of this regulation system breaks down, it can lead to diabetes insipidus."

While the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, it is thought to be an autoimmune response; something, such as a virus, triggers the body’s immune system to create an antibody that kills the cells in the pancreas responsible for making insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps to lower blood sugar by allowing sugar to pass from the blood into the cells. When there is no insulin, blood sugar, called glucose, builds up in the blood. Glucose is a natural sugar that your body uses as a source of energy. It is obtained from food. Extra glucose is stored in the liver and muscle tissues. It is released when extra energy is needed, such as between meals or when sleeping.Normal levels of blood sugar are helpful, but when it builds up, it can cause both short term and long term problems."

The infection occurs  when your sinuses and nasal passages become inflamed. The sinuses are small air pockets located behind your forehead,  nose, cheekbones, and eyes. The sinuses produce mucus, which is a jelly-like  liquid that protects the body by trapping germs. Sometimes, bacteria or  allergens can cause too much mucus to form, which blocks the openings of your  sinuses. Excess mucus is common if you have a cold or allergies. This  mucus buildup can encourage bacteria and germs to grow in your sinus cavity,  leading to a bacterial or viral infection. Most sinus infections are viral, and  go away in a week or two without treatment. If your symptoms do not improve  within a few weeks, you likely have a bacterial infection and should schedule  an appointment with your doctor."

Three to four percent of children suffer from SAD (Walker,  et al., 2011). SAD tends to be indicative of general mood and mental health  issues: Around one-third of children with SAD will be diagnosed with mental  illness as an adult. Approximately half of childhood mental health referrals are  for suspected SAD (Ehrenreich,  et al., 2008). "

Colorado tick fever is one of the manydiseases that ticks may transmit. Colorado tick fever is limited to Canada and the western UnitedStates. The disease is most prevalent in the state of Colorado. Incidence ofColorado tick fever is highest between February and October, with 90 percentof cases being reported between April and July. You are at an increased riskfor the disease if you spend time outdoors in tick-infested areas.Symptoms of Colorado tick fever may include headaches, fever, andchills. These symptoms often begin within three to six days after a tick biteoccurs. This period of time is referred to as the incubation period. Oncesymptoms develop, they usually go away within 10 days. Treatment is rarelyrequired, and most people make a full recovery without complications. Colorado tick fever is sometimes referred to as mountain tickfever or American mountain fever."

It is also a time when children can’t yet  speak well enough to make their needs known. This combination is a “perfect  storm” for tantrums. Fatigue, hunger, and illness can make tantrums worse or  more frequent. In most cases, tantrums begin to wane over time and usually disappear  by age four.  When your child is throwing a  tantrum, you may be tempted to think it’s your fault. It isn’t. Tantrums are a  normal part of childhood development, and they don’t occur because you’ve been  a bad parent or because you’ve done something wrong."

For some, the symptomscan include severe bleeding and are possibly fatal if they’re not treated.Other people may not experience any symptoms.Typically, a low platelet count is the result of a medical condition,like leukemia, or certain drugs. The treatment usually addresses the conditioncausing the thrombocytopenia."

The damage weakens the heart muscle  and causes the heart to become enlarged. As a result, the heart can’t pump  blood properly throughout the rest of the body.   According to  the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, this heart condition affects about one  in every 3,000 to 4,000 women each year. Women are diagnosed during the last  month of their pregnancies or within five months of delivery (CRF).   Certain  pre-pregnancy factors can increase your risk of developing this condition.

According to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, approximately700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States.Most of them are diagnosed among young children. It’s usually diagnosed beforethey reach the age of 5.Is neuroblastoma inherited?Most cases of neuroblastoma aren’t inherited but are theresult of a random gene mutation. Approximately 1-2% of neuroblastomas are inherited in an autosomaldominant pattern. This means that you only need a gene from one parent to havethe condition. Not all people who inherit such a gene develop neuroblastoma.This is known as “incomplete penetrance.” Experts believe that an additional mutationis required to develop neuroblastoma."

These tumors are made of gland and fibrous tissue aswell as blood vessels. They are most common in women between ages 35 and 55.There are no known risk factors for intraductal papilloma. When a single tumor grows in large milk ducts, it’s called asolitary intraductal papilloma. It’s typically felt as a small lump near thenipple, and it may cause nipple discharge or bleeding. This type of lump isn’tassociated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Ducts farther away from the nipple are smaller, and papillomas inthis area typically manifest as clusters of little tumors. These tumors arecalled multiple papillomas, and they have been associated with a slightlyhigher risk of breast cancer. This is because multiple papillomas have been linkedto a precancerous breast condition called atypical hyperplasia. A condition called papillomatosis is sometimes grouped in withintraductal papillomas. It develops when there’s an abnormal overgrowth ofcells in the milk ducts. Papillomatosis is also associated with a higher riskof breast cancer."

But it’s one of the more common syndromes caused by chromosomaldeletion.“Cri-du-chat” means “cry of the cat” in French. Infants with thesyndrome produce a high-pitched cry that sounds like a cat. The larynx developsabnormally due to the chromosome deletion. This affects the sound of thechild’s cry. The syndrome is more noticeable as the child ages, but becomesdifficult to diagnose past age 2.Crying cat also carries many disabilities and abnormalities. Asmall percentage of infants with crying cat syndrome are born with seriousorgan defects (especially heart or kidney defects) or other life-threateningcomplications that can result in death. Most fatal complications occur beforethe child’s first birthday.Children who reach age 1 generally have a normal lifeexpectancy. But the child will most likely have lifelong physical ordevelopment complications. These complications will depend on the severity ofthe syndrome.About about half of children with crying cat syndrome learnenough words to communicate, and most grow up to be happy, friendly, andsociable."

The retina works with the cornea,  lens, and other parts of the eye and the brain to produce normal vision.Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates  from the back of the eye. This causes loss of vision that can be partial or  total, depending on how much of the retina is detached. Retinal detachment is a  medical emergency. When your retina becomes detached, its cells may be deprived  of oxygen. See your doctor immediately if you suspect you have retinal  detachment. If left untreated or if treatment  of retinal detachment is delayed, you risk permanent vision loss."

      "description": "Dry eyes occur when your eyes do not produce enough tears,  or produce tears that can’t effectively keep your eyes moist. Tears are needed  to help keep enough moisture in your eyes. They keep the eye surface smooth,  wash away foreign materials, and also help to protect the eyes from infection.  Dry eyes may sting or burn and can be very uncomfortable.  You may experience dry eyes all the time or only during certain situations. For  instance, you may have dry eyes after staring at a computer for a long time, or  when it is windy outside. Both eyes are usually affected at the same time.  Eye dryness will likely affect everyone at one point or  another in his or her life. It is rarely serious and can usually be treated  with simple, over-the-counter solutions. "
